## 1. Auth Flow

### A1 — Mobile Number Entry

| State | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Default/empty | ✅ | CTA disabled |
| Filled/valid | ✅ | CTA enabled (after 10-digit entry + consent) |
| Loading/submitting | ✅ | `mobileState = 'loading'` — CTA spinner, field disabled |
| Error | ✅ | `mobileState = 'error'` — inline error via `AlTextField` |
| Offline | ✅ | `mobileState = 'offline'` — `AlOfflineChip` shown, field disabled |
| Validation failure (inline) | ✅ | "Enter your 10-digit number, no 0 or +91 in front." |
| Consent unchecked | ✅ | CTA disabled (`!consentAccepted`) |

**Form validation:**
- 10-digit max: ✅ (`clampMobileInput` strips `/\D/g` + `.slice(0, 10)`)
- Non-numeric rejection: ✅ (stripping applied on every `onChange`)
- Paste handling: ✅ (same `onChange` handler handles paste)
- CTA gate: ✅ `hasMobile && consentAccepted && !isOffline && !isError && !isLoading`

⚠️ **API note:** `isValidMobile()` hardcoded to `=== '9999999999'` — replace with format check + API call for production.

| Wrong OTP | ✅ | `otpErrorKind = 'wrong'` — "Incorrect code, try again" via `role="alert"` |
| Expired OTP | ✅ | `otpErrorKind = 'expired'` — "This code has expired. Request a new OTP." |
| Network error | ✅ | `otpState = 'network-error'` |
| Resend failed | ✅ | `otpState = 'resend-failed'` |
| Offline | ✅ | `otpState = 'offline'` |
| Resend cooldown | ✅ | 24-second countdown, resend button hidden until 0 |
| Paste 6 digits | ✅ | Auto-verify fires via `onChange` when `value.length === 6` |
