# Memory Update Report

**Date:** 2026-06-17  
**Action:** Project lockdown + future development charter  
**Verdict:** **BASELINE LOCKED**

---

## Summary

The Autolokate PWA implementation is now formally locked as the reference baseline. Three permanent charter documents were created and three existing memory/index files were updated.

---

## Documents Created

| Document | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Project Charter | `docs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md` | Baseline lock, locked areas, change control, priority order |
| Architecture Principles | `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md` | Provider tree, session keys, flows, QR, PWA architecture |
| Development Standards | `docs/DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md` | TS, React, imports, components, PWA release gates |
| Memory Update Report | `docs/MEMORY_UPDATE_REPORT.md` | This file |

---

## Documents Updated

| Document | Changes |
|----------|---------|
| `memory/MEMORY.md` | Added charter docs to source-of-truth table; baseline locked status; updated truth hierarchy |
| `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` | Added baseline locked section; updated default mode to charter priority order; expanded active docs list |
| `docs/CLAUDE_PROJECT_INDEX.md` | Added §0 charter reference; baseline locked banner; pointer to permanent docs |

---

## Locked Areas Documented

| Lock | Documented in |
|------|---------------|
| UI / Figma parity | `PROJECT_CHARTER.md` § UI Lock, `DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md` §8 |
| Flow order + orchestration | `PROJECT_CHARTER.md` § Flow Lock, `ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md` §6 |
| Session schema + storage keys | `PROJECT_CHARTER.md` § Session Lock, `ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md` §4 |
| Component ownership | `PROJECT_CHARTER.md` § Component Lock, `DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md` §7 |
| Import architecture | `PROJECT_CHARTER.md` § Import Lock, `DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md` §6 |
| React standards | `DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md` §5 |
| PWA release requirements | `DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md` §11, `ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md` §10 |

---

## Baseline State at Lock

| Domain | Status | Reference |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Visual | PIXEL PERFECT VERIFIED | `VISUAL_TRUTH_MATRIX_V2.md` |
| Engineering | READY WITH KNOWN GAPS | `FINAL_SANITY_REPORT.md` |
| Lint / TS / Build | Pass | Engineering hardening sprint |
| Device QA | Not executed | `REAL_DEVICE_EVIDENCE_REPORT.md` |

Baseline lock does **not** claim production release readiness on hardware — it locks the **architecture and implementation** as the reference for future work.

---

## Truth Hierarchy (Updated)

1. Figma
2. `VISUAL_TRUTH_MATRIX_V2.md` + visual evidence
3. **`PROJECT_CHARTER.md`** + **`ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md`** + **`DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md`**
4. `PROJECT_STATUS.md` / signoff docs
5. `docs/archive/` (historical only)

---

## Default Mode (Updated)

Previous default: "visual refinement and Figma parity"

New default priority order:

1. Preserve architecture
2. Preserve flow behavior
3. Preserve session behavior
4. Preserve component ownership
5. Preserve design system
6. Preserve Figma parity
7. Add new functionality

---

## Active Docs Count

| Location | Count |
|----------|------:|
| `docs/` root (permanent + signoffs) | 16 |
| `docs/archive/` | 231+ |

Permanent charter trio added to active set alongside existing signoffs and indexes.

---

## Final Verdict

# BASELINE LOCKED

All future Autolokate development builds on this repository as the reference implementation under the rules in `PROJECT_CHARTER.md`.
