# Final Production Readiness

**Date:** 2026-06-20  
**Pass:** Full Repository Production Hardening  
**Auditor:** Automated + code review (10 phases)

---

## Final Verdict

# READY WITH KNOWN GAPS

The codebase is **production-quality for demo deployment**: type-safe, lint-clean, builds successfully, and all primary activation flows remain intact. Known gaps are documented architectural items explicitly excluded from this pass (guard wiring, schema alignment, deep-link hardening, bundle optimization).

## Phase Completion Summary

| Phase | Status | Key Outcome |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 — Repository Health | ✅ | Lint/type/build clean; large files justified |
| 2 — React Quality | ✅ | Effect stability fixed; no setState-in-render |
| 3 — TypeScript | ✅ | 0 errors; deprecated API usage cleaned |
| 4 — Route Audit | ⚠️ | Gaps documented; guards not changed |
| 5 — State Management | ✅ | Single source of truth; race fixes applied |
| 6 — Performance | ⚠️ | Bundle warning; SOS wav 3.5 MB |
| 7 — Component Ownership | ✅ | Primitives in `@autolokate/ui` |
| 8 — File Structure | ✅ | Cohesive large files retained |
| 9 — Regression Safety | ✅ | No flow/business changes |
| 10 — Final Verification | ✅ | All automated checks pass |

## Files Touched (This Pass)

### PWA
- `hooks/use-geolocation.ts`
- `hooks/use-pwa-photo-capture.ts`
- `routes/pwa-park-me-routes.tsx`
- `routes/pwa-sos-routes.tsx`
- `routes/pwa-shared-routes.tsx`
- `context/PwaScanContext.tsx`
- `storage/pwa-scan-storage.ts`
- `utils/compress-capture-image.ts`

### Journey
- `journey/routes/PurchaseRoutes.tsx`
- `journey/routes/AuthRoutes.tsx`

### UI Package
- `PhotoGrid/PhotoGrid.tsx`
- `ScannedVehicleCard/ScannedVehicleCard.tsx`
- `DispatchTimeline/DispatchTimeline.tsx`
- `ScreenSpinner/ScreenSpinner.tsx`
- `SosHoldButton/SosHoldButton.tsx`

### App Compositions
- `EmergencyContactRow.tsx`
- `RelationshipSelector.tsx`

## Risk Matrix

| Area | Risk Level | Regression Risk |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| Lint/TS fixes | Low | Low |
| Purchase effect memoization | Low | Low |
| PWA hook guards | Low | Low |
| Deprecated prop migration | Low | Low |
| Documented guard gaps | Medium (security/deep link) | None (not modified) |
| Bundle size | Medium (load time) | None |

---

## Remaining Gaps (Prioritized)

### P1 — Document / Future Sprint
1. Wire or remove declarative guard catalog in `routes.schema.ts`
2. Add mount guards for `/journey/completed`, prepaid/B2B2C welcome
3. PWA verify deep-link prerequisite redirects
4. Mount `/activate/:token` or remove from schema
5. Emergency sub-route session prerequisites (R1–R3, E2–E3)

### P2 — Optimization / Cleanup
1. Code-split PWA vs journey bundles
2. Compress/stream SOS wav asset
3. Delete dev orphan screens (P01–P06, R14/R15)
4. Consolidate mobile format helpers
5. Migrate `RetakeIcon` to `@autolokate/icons`
6. Persist `phase` or document as intentional ephemeral state
7. Add PWA paths to `routes.schema.ts`

## Signoff Alignment

| Area | Latest Signoff | Hardening Impact |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| Auth | `AUTH_FIGMA_PARITY_SIGNOFF.md` | None |
| Purchase | `PURCHASE_FINAL_SIGNOFF.md` | Effect stability only |
| Emergency | `EMERGENCY_FINAL_SIGNOFF.md` | Relationship import cleanup |
| Prepaid | Active | None |
| B2B2C | Active | None |
| PWA | `POST_ACTIVATION_FINAL_SIGNOFF_V4.md` | Hook/route hardening only |

## Deployment Checklist

- [x] `pnpm -r typecheck` — PASS
- [x] `pnpm -r lint` — PASS
- [x] `pnpm -r build` — PASS
- [x] No session schema changes
- [x] No route order changes
- [x] No guard logic changes
- [x] No business rule changes
- [ ] Visual spot-check at 375px (recommended — tooling unavailable)
- [ ] Error reporting service for PWA error boundary (pre-prod)
- [ ] CDN strategy for 3.5 MB SOS wav (pre-prod)

## Conclusion

The repository meets **production-grade code quality standards** for the Autolokate onboarding demo. All automated quality gates pass. Known gaps are **architectural and operational**, not code defects, and were intentionally preserved to avoid flow regressions.

**Final verdict: READY WITH KNOWN GAPS**
