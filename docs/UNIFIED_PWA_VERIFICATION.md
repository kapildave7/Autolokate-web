# Unified PWA Verification

**Date:** 2026-06-17  
**Scope:** Verification only — no code changes  
**Phase verified:** Safe Unified PWA Phase 1

---

## Method

Static code-path audit, provider mount analysis, cross-flow trace, and production build (`npm run build` — 12/12 pass). No runtime browser E2E in this pass.

---

## Flow verification

| Flow | Entry | Dispatcher path | First route | Status |
|------|-------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| **Purchase** | `/journey` card 1 | `dispatchPlatformFlow({ flowId: 'purchase', source: 'homeCard' })` → `selectActivationFlow('purchase')` | `/journey/auth/mobile` | ✅ Verified |
| **Prepaid** | `/journey` card 2 | `dispatchPlatformFlow({ flowId: 'prepaid', ... })` → `selectActivationFlow('prepaid')` | `/journey/prepaid/welcome` | ✅ Verified |
| **B2B2C** | `/journey` card 3 | `dispatchPlatformFlow({ flowId: 'b2b2c', ... })` → `selectActivationFlow('b2b2c')` | `/journey/b2b2c/welcome` | ✅ Verified |
| **Post Activation** | `/journey` card 4 | `dispatchPlatformFlow({ flowId: 'postActivation', ... })` → `navigate(pwaScanPaths.loading)` | `/pwa/scan/loading` | ✅ Verified |

---

## Component checks

### Flow Dispatcher

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Single entry point `dispatchPlatformFlow` | ✅ |
| Activation flows delegate to unchanged `selectActivationFlow` | ✅ |
| Post-activation navigates to `/pwa/scan/loading` only | ✅ |
| No session writes in dispatcher | ✅ |
| Pure function — no React hooks | ✅ |
| `source` field recorded but does not alter behavior | ✅ |

### Entry Registry

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| 4 flows registered in `FLOW_ENTRY_REGISTRY` | ✅ |
| Labels match prior `flowLabels` + post-activation copy | ✅ |
| `ACTIVATION_FLOW_ENTRIES` drives cards 1–3 | ✅ |
| `POST_ACTIVATION_FLOW_ENTRY` drives card 4 | ✅ |
| `FlowEntryScreen` consumes registry | ✅ |
| `FlowHubScreen` consumes registry | ✅ |

### Root Provider

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `AutolokateRootProvider` wraps full route tree | ✅ |
| Nesting: `JourneyProvider` → `PwaScanProvider` → routes | ✅ |
| Single mount in `JourneyOrchestrator` | ✅ |
| No nested `PwaScanProvider` in `PwaScanRoutes` | ✅ |
| Stateless wrapper — no extra state layer | ✅ |
| `useJourney` / `usePwaScan` APIs unchanged | ✅ |

---

## Cross-cutting checks

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Cross-navigation** | ✅ | Providers remain mounted; route components swap only |
| **Theme persistence** | ✅ | `localStorage` `al-onboarding-theme` + `data-theme` on `<html>`; independent of providers |
| **Session persistence** | ✅ | Dual keys unchanged; writes via existing provider methods |
| **Back navigation** | ✅ | React Router history; browser back from PWA → `/journey` preserves context |
| **Refresh behavior** | ✅ | Full reload hydrates both sessions from `sessionStorage` at provider init |
| **Dark mode** | ✅ | Theme applied at boot (`main.tsx`) and toggled on entry screen |
| **Light mode** | ✅ | Same mechanism |
| **Responsive** | ✅ | Unchanged — `screen-viewport.css` + existing shell CSS; Phase 1 added no layout code |

## Special cross-flow scenarios

### Purchase → Completed → PWA

| Step | Behavior | Provider reset? | Session |
|------|----------|-----------------|---------|
| Complete activation | `/journey/completed` | No | Journey in memory + `al-journey-v1` |
| "Go to home" | `clearJourney()` + `/journey` | No | Journey cleared **by design** |
| PWA card | `navigate(/pwa/scan/loading)` | No | PWA slice unchanged |
| Loading → vehicle | `updateSession({ bootstrapComplete: true })` | No | PWA persisted to `al-pwa-scan-v1` |

**Without "Go to home":** Journey session remains until `clearJourney` — pre-existing; not a Phase 1 regression.

### PWA → Home → Purchase

| Step | Behavior | Provider reset? | Session |
|------|----------|-----------------|---------|
| In PWA flow | `/pwa/scan/*` | No | PWA context + storage active |
| Navigate to `/journey` | Browser back or manual URL | No | Both slices in memory |
| Purchase card | `setSelectedFlow('purchase')` + auth route | No | Journey updated; PWA slice untouched |

**Note:** No in-app "Home" link inside PWA routes — return to `/journey` via browser back or URL. Pre-existing UX; not introduced by Phase 1.

### Prepaid → Home → PWA

| Step | Behavior | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Welcome back button | `navigate(journeyPaths.root)` | ✅ |
| PWA card | Navigate only, no `setSelectedFlow` | ✅ |
| Providers | Stay mounted | ✅ |

### B2B2C → Home → Purchase

| Step | Behavior | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Welcome back button | `navigate(journeyPaths.root)` | ✅ |
| Purchase card | Standard activation dispatch | ✅ |
| Flow mismatch guard | `RequireSelectedFlowMatch` if stale flow + auth — pre-existing | ✅ Unchanged |

---

## Redirect verification

| Trigger | Redirect | Changed? |
|---------|----------|----------|
| `/` | `/journey` | No |
| `/pwa/scan/` | `/pwa/scan/loading` | No |
| Unknown PWA path | `/pwa/scan/loading` | No |
| Unknown journey path | `/journey` | No |
| Unauthenticated purchase | `/journey/auth/mobile` | No |
| Flow mismatch | `getPostAuthActivationPath(...)` | No |

---

## Build verification

```
npm run build — 12/12 packages successful (exit 0)
Onboarding JS bundle: 1,083.68 kB (gzip 275.81 kB)
Delta vs pre-Phase-1: ~+0.8 kB JS (platform module)
```

---

## Known pre-existing behaviors (not Phase 1 issues)

| Behavior | Classification |
|----------|----------------|
| Dual session stores (`al-journey-v1` + `al-pwa-scan-v1`) | By design |
| `clearJourney()` on completed "Go to home" | Intentional |
| PWA session hydrates at app boot on journey-only visits | Phase 1 acceptable tradeoff |
| Dev preview (`?dev=1`) uses standalone `JourneyProvider` | Separate from production path |
| `resetSession()` exported but never called from routes | No accidental PWA reset |

---

## Final verdict

# VERIFIED

Phase 1 Safe Unified PWA implementation meets verification criteria. All four flows dispatch correctly. Root provider is stable and singular. No provider remount on cross-navigation. No session schema or guard changes. No route regressions identified in static audit.

**Caveat:** Full browser E2E on device (iOS/Android) recommended for manual sign-off; not executed in this verification pass.
