# Post-Activation PWA — Final Sign-Off V4

**Date:** 2026-06-18  
**Sprint:** Screen Rebuild (Phases 1–3)  
**Reference audit:** [POST_ACTIVATION_VISUAL_RECONSTRUCTION_AUDIT.md](POST_ACTIVATION_VISUAL_RECONSTRUCTION_AUDIT.md)  

---

## Verdict

### **NOT READY** for global success criteria

Rebuilt screens (13/13) no longer Grade D. Full 30-screen product still has Grade C drift on auth, scene review, and ancillary frames.

---

## Rebuilt screen grades (13 targeted)

| Phase | Screens | Grade D before | Grade D after |
|-------|---------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | 06, 08, 08b, 09, 09b | 5 | **0** |
| 2 | 14, 14b, 14c, 14d, 17 | 5 | **0** |
| 3 | 19, 20, 21 | 3 | **0** |
| **Total** | **13** | **13** | **0** |

All rebuilt screens visually match Figma **structure** (Grade B). None are Grade A (pixel-identical).

---

## Global success criteria (30 screens)

| Criterion | Target | Actual (post-rebuild estimate) | Pass |
|-----------|--------|--------------------------------|------|
| Grade D | 0 | **1** (15b scene captured — not in sprint scope) | ❌ |
| Grade C | ≤ 3 | **~9** (03–05, 07, 15b, 16, 18, 22, 23, 02 polish) | ❌ |
| Grade B | ≤ 5 | **~18** | ❌ |
| Grade A | ≥ 22 | **~2** (01, 10) | ❌ |

---

## Broken UI fixes (user report)

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| SOS hold ring misaligned from disc | `AlSosHoldButton` stage rebuilt — concentric layout |
| Vehicle found extra “· Safe” on badge | Footer copy → “Protected by Autolokate” only |
| Scene photos wrong title/spacing | Figma copy + `pwa-scan-scene-photos-screen` spacing |
| 09b empty photo review | Review cards always render gradient base + retake icons |

---

## What now looks like Figma (structure)

**13 rebuilt screens** — designer would recognize the same layout hierarchy as Figma.

**~8 additional screens** were already Grade B pre-sprint (01, 10–13, partial 02).

**~9 screens** still need polish passes (auth shell, 15b, 16, 18, 22, 23, 07, 02 typography).

---

## What only behaves like Figma

All **30 routes** remain functional. Non-rebuilt screens still implement correct flows with wrong visual composition.

## Recommended next sprint (to reach READY)

1. **15b** — Rebuild scene photo review (retake icons, Figma copy) — currently Grade D
2. **03–05** — Auth shell wordmark + helper text parity
3. **07** — Park Me looking-up vertical centering
4. **16, 18, 22** — Status hero halos and button shapes
5. **Global Grade A pass** — typography tokens, 2px spacing audit on Grade B screens
