# Post-Activation PWA — Parity Recovery Report

**Date:** 2026-06-18  
**Sprint:** Parity recovery (signoff backlog only)  
**Baseline:** `POST_ACTIVATION_FINAL_SIGNOFF.md` (~71% verified parity)  
**Figma section:** `843:2079`

---

## Summary

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Overall Figma parity | **~71%** | **~98%** |
| P0 blockers open | 5 | 0 |
| Dead routes | 2 | 0 |
| Build | PASS | PASS |

### Verdict: **NOT READY** (below 100% rule)

All signoff P0 blockers were closed in code. Residual gaps are frame 09b review layout polish, full responsive QA matrix, and two motion intents not yet component-scoped.

---

## P0 fixes delivered

| # | Blocker | Resolution |
|---|---------|------------|
| 1 | Generic 4-step CC tracker | Rebuilt `AlDispatchTimeline` — 6-step Park Me / 10-step SOS, titles + subtitles, amber active halos, per-step glyphs (`shield-check`, `phone`, `activity`, `triangle-alert`), green completed rails |
| 2 | Park Me photos 2-column grid | `AlPhotoGrid` `stacked` layout + `AlScenePhotoCard` 160px boxes; Figma copy; `camera` icons; CTA **Send to owner**; helper **Add photos and location to continue** |
| 3 | Dead branches | Demo name **Photo Fail** → `/park-me/photo-not-clear`; **Network Fail** or offline → `/sos/couldnt-send` |
| 4 | Full RC card on vehicle hub | New `AlScannedVehicleCard` (Figma 843:2080 compact card) replaces `AlVehicleRcCard` on frame 02 |
| 5 | Loading-only entry | Loading route now: live camera viewport → scan overlay → opening spinner with Figma subtitle |

---

## Screens fixed (by frame)

| Frame | Route | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 01 | `/pwa/scan/loading` | QR scanner viewport + opening copy |
| 02 | `/pwa/scan/vehicle` | Compact vehicle card; `bell` + `chevron-right` hub icons |
| 07 | `/park-me/looking-up` | Park Me lookup copy |
| 09 | `/park-me/photos` | Stacked capture layout + Send to owner |
| 10–12 | Park Me status | Figma titles, subtitles, 6-step timelines |
| 13 | `/park-me/photo-not-clear` | Reachable; Figma copy + error timeline |
| 14 | `/sos` | Emergency title, location chip, call 112 fallback |
| 17–18 | Sending / couldn't send | Network fail demo path |
| 19–21 | SOS status | 10-step timelines, Help is on the way copy, cancel CTA |
| 23 | `/sos/contacts-only` | 3-step contacts timeline + Figma copy |

---

## Icon recovery

| Area | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Emergency hub | `heart` | `bell` |
| Photo capture | `scan-line` | `camera` |
| Hub chevron | inline SVG | `chevron-right` export |
| Timeline active | generic / phone only | `shield-check`, `phone`, `activity`, `triangle-alert` |

Added to `@autolokate/icons`: `camera`, `activity`, `chevron-right`, `triangle-alert`.

---

## Animations

| Intent | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Timeline amber halo pulse | CSS component animation on active/error steps |
| SOS hold ring | Existing `AlSosHoldButton` progress arc |
| Photo capture success | Pending — no fill-state motion yet |
| Vehicle lookup success | Pending — R04/R05 unchanged shell |
| Dispatch step transitions | Halo + rail color transitions only |

---

## Remaining gaps (~2%)

1. **Frame 09b** review still uses 2-column photo preview grid (Figma 1044:2406 uses stacked filled cards).
2. **Full QA matrix** — breakpoints 320–414, light/dark, all branches not re-run in this session.
3. **Photo capture success / vehicle lookup** component-level motion not implemented.

---

## Demo paths (deterministic)

| Branch | Trigger |
|--------|---------|
| Photo not clear (13) | Enter name **Photo Fail** on verify screen 05, complete Park Me through send |
| Couldn't send (18) | Enter name **Network Fail** on verify screen 05, complete SOS hold → send |
| Couldn't send (18) alt | Toggle offline (`navigator.onLine === false`) before send |

Happy path unchanged: mobile `9999999999`, OTP `123456`, reporter plate `MH 12 AB 3456`.
