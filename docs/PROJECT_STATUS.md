# Autolokate Onboarding — Project Status

**Last updated:** 2026-06-20 (Docs consolidation — PIXEL PERFECT VERIFIED)  
**Source of truth priority:** Figma → `VISUAL_TRUTH_MATRIX_V2.md` → `FINAL_THEME_SIGNOFF.md` → `FINAL_PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` → `docs/archive/` (historical)

---

## What This Repo Is

**Not the Consumer App.**

This repo is the **Autolokate Onboarding + Activation + Post-Activation PWA** only:

- Consumer QR onboarding (Purchase, Prepaid, B2B2C flows)
- Shared Auth (Mobile → OTP → Vehicle owner name)
- Emergency + Rider contact setup
- Post-Activation PWA (SOS Emergency, Park Me)

**Journey entry:** `/journey`  
**PWA entry:** `/pwa/scan/*` (isolated — no JourneyProvider, no shared session)

---

## Current Flows

| Flow | Entry | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Purchase** | `/journey` → Auth → R03–R10 → Emergency | PIXEL PERFECT |
| **Prepaid** | `/journey` → PrepaidWelcome → Auth → Emergency | Active / Functional |
| **B2B2C** | `/journey` → PartnerWelcome → Auth → Emergency | Active / Functional |
| **Emergency** | After activation (all flows) | PIXEL PERFECT |
| **Auth (Shared)** | `/journey/auth/*` | PIXEL PERFECT |
| **Post-Activation PWA** | `/pwa/scan/*` | PIXEL PERFECT |

  - shield: 3 contacts, 2 riders
  - shield+: 3 contacts, 2 riders

### Post-Activation PWA — PIXEL PERFECT

- **Latest signoff:** `POST_ACTIVATION_FINAL_SIGNOFF_V4.md` + PWA Pixel Perfect Pass 2026-06-20
- **All 30 frames wired and signed off**
- SOS: hold required (4000ms) — tap must never trigger
- Park Me: auth required, location must never be hardcoded
- **Fixed in PWA pixel-perfect pass (2026-06-20):**
  - ✅ Systematic heading drift: all 23 `variant="h1"` (36px) → `variant="h2"` (28px) across PWA routes

  - ✅ Hub screen description line-height: 19px (Figma `400/16px/lh=19.4`)
  - ✅ Location chip token compliance: 3 hardcoded hex → design tokens
  - ✅ Call fallback lh: 18px → 17px in both `pwa-emergency-screen.css` and `pwa-scan.css`
  - ✅ Emergency subtitle: font-size 15px, line-height 18px
  - ✅ AlVehicleConfirmationCard: plate 15→18px/600→700/18→22lh; model+plate order swap; icon-well 40→44px/r10→r12; copy gap 2→8px; grid col 40→44px; SVG 18→22px
  - ✅ AlScannedVehicleCard: plate 15→18px/600→700/18→22lh; model+plate order swap; copy gap 4→8px; SVG 20→24px
  - ✅ AlPermissionSheet: title lh 26→24px; description lh 22→18px; secondary lh 20→18px
  - ✅ B2B2C/Welcome Activation: 8 line-height drifts closed across section-label, error-title, error-message, partner-subtitle, plan text elements
- **Open gaps (P2 only):**
  - PWA heading weight: Figma shows `600` but design system h2 token uses `700` — 1-level weight difference accepted

### Prepaid — Active

- Welcome screen wired at `/journey/prepaid/welcome`
- No purchase, no payment, no vehicle activation
- Routes to Emergency after auth

### B2B2C — Active

- Welcome screen at `/journey/b2b2c/welcome` (plan-only) and `/journey/b2b2c/welcome/plan-rider`
- No purchase, no payment, no vehicle activation
- Routes to Emergency after auth

---

## Known Decisions (Locked)

### Architecture — Never change without explicit instruction

- Journey phase order: `home → flow-select → shared-auth → activation → emergency → completed`
- Purchase route sequence: R03 → R04 → R05 → R06 → R07 → R08 → R09 → R10 → Emergency
- Emergency handoff from Purchase: always enters at `contacts-empty` (not `rider-prompt`)
- Auth completion: routes to `vehicle-owner`, not directly to activation
- Session persistence: `sessionStorage` for journey state, `localStorage` for flow selection + theme
- PWA isolation: `/pwa/scan/*` has no `JourneyProvider`, no shared session with onboarding

### Archived — Do Not Restore

- **R14 Permissions:** archived
- **R15 Activation Complete:** archived
- **Splash screen:** deprecated, redirects to Mobile

### Component Ownership (Precise)

| Component | Correct usage |
|-----------|---------------|
| `AlVehicleConfirmationCard` | Scanner confirmation only — NOT for purchase RC confirm |
| `AlScannedVehicleCard` | Scan result display only |
| `AlDispatchTimeline` | Shared timeline primitive |
| `AlSosHoldButton` | Single implementation — no alternates |

### Design Rules

- Status bar: **never render**
- Fake mobile chrome: **never render**
- Battery / network indicators: **never render**
- Language picker: removed
- Theme: Dark + Light — toggled at `/journey` only

### Default Mode

All future work defaults to **visual refinement and Figma parity**. Do not redesign flows, business rules, or session architecture without explicit instruction.
