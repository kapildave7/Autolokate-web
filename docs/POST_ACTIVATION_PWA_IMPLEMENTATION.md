# Post-Activation PWA — Implementation Report

**Date:** 2026-06-17  
**Reference audit:** `docs/POST_ACTIVATION_QR_AUDIT.md`  
**Figma section:** Scanner · QR Scan (Post-Activation) · Web PWA · READY FOR DEV (`843:2079`)

---

## Summary

Implemented a **fully isolated** Post-Activation Web PWA at `/pwa/scan/*`, separate from onboarding journey orchestration and session schema. All **30 audited frames** have dedicated routes, real browser APIs (camera, geolocation, permissions), and reuse of existing onboarding primitives.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Figma frames implemented | **30 / 30** |
| PWA routes | **30** |
| Onboarding flows modified | **0** (entry card only on `/journey`) |
| Promoted UI components | **8** |
| Build status | **PASS** |
| TypeScript errors | **0** |

---

## Entry point

**`/journey`** — 4th card added:

- **Label:** QR Scan (Post-Activation)
- **Description:** Already activated vehicle
- **Action:** Navigates to `/pwa/scan/loading`

Direct deep links: `/pwa/scan/*` (e.g. `/pwa/scan/vehicle`, `/pwa/scan/sos`)

---

## Architecture

```
JourneyOrchestrator
├── /pwa/scan/*     → PwaScanProvider + PwaScanRoutes (isolated)
└── /*              → JourneyProvider + JourneyRoutes (onboarding)
```

- **Session:** `sessionStorage` key `al-pwa-scan-v1` — not shared with `al-journey-v1`
- **Feature root:** `apps/onboarding/src/features/post-activation-pwa/`

## Motion (Framer Motion)

- `PwaFade` — screen enter transitions
- `PwaSpringPress` — hub card press/select
- SOS hold progress — CSS + `useHoldProgress` rAF
- Timeline steps — CSS transitions on `AlDispatchTimeline`

---

## Exclusions (per project rules)

- No StatusBar / battery / carrier / signal
- No language switcher / picker on verify mobile

---

## Demo credentials

| Input | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Mobile | `9999999999` |
| OTP valid | `123456` |
| OTP expired | `000000` |
| Consumer reporter plate | `MH 12 AB 3456` → protected confirm (08b) |
