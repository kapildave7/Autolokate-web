**Date:** 2026-06-18  
**Scope:** SOS timeline frames 19, 20, 21 (Grade D → rebuilt from Figma)  
**Method:** Side-by-side Figma PNG vs live PNG after rebuild

## Summary

| Screen | Node | Route | Before grade | After grade | Status |
|--------|------|-------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| 19 Help received | `849:321` | `/pwa/scan/sos/help-received` | D | **B** | Rebuilt |
| 20 Help dispatched | `870:2145` | `/pwa/scan/sos/help-dispatched` | D | **B** | Rebuilt |
| 21 Incident resolved | `871:2151` | `/pwa/scan/sos/resolved` | D | **B** | Rebuilt |

**Phase 3 result:** Sticky footer + compact SOS timeline restores Figma terminal layout.

## What was rebuilt

### `PwaScanShell` sticky footer mode
- `stickyFooter` prop: scrollable main + pinned footer CTA
- Fixes off-screen “I'm safe, cancel alert” and “Done” buttons

### `AlDispatchTimeline` SOS variant
- Tighter connector heights (16–18px vs 27–32px)
- Reduced step min-height (36px vs 50px)
- Smaller active halo (24px vs 28px)

### Screen composition
Each route now uses:
```
[ wordmark header ]
[ title + subtitle ]
[ vehicle chip ]
[ 10-step SOS timeline — scrolls ]
[ pinned footer CTA ]
```
