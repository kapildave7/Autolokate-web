# Final Screen Verification — Post-Activation PWA

**Date:** 2026-06-17  
**Build:** `@autolokate/onboarding` production build ✓  
**Preview:** `http://127.0.0.1:5175/pwa/scan/*`

---

## Verification Method

1. TypeScript + Vite production build
2. Playwright recapture for SOS + status screens (`docs/audit-screenshots/recapture-fixes.mjs`)
3. Code-level route + component audit
4. Layout audit baseline (`docs/audit-screenshots/layout-audit-results.json`)

Physical iOS/Android device testing: **not performed in this session**.

| No black header rectangles | ✓ (code + desktop preview) |
| SOS skips auth | ✓ |
| Park Me keeps auth | ✓ |
| Single-step Park Me photos | ✓ |
| No hardcoded locations | ✓ |

## Screenshot Index

### After (Post-Fix)
```

docs/audit-screenshots/live/19-help-received.png
docs/audit-screenshots/live/20-help-dispatched.png
docs/audit-screenshots/live/21-incident-resolved.png
```

### Before (Reference)
Pre-fix captures in `docs/audit-screenshots/` root numbered files (01–21 series from prior QA runs).

To regenerate full matrix:
```bash
cd docs/audit-screenshots
node layout-audit.mjs
node recapture-fixes.mjs
```

## Regression Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Review route bookmarks | Redirect to photos |
| SOS deep link while unverified | Now allowed by design |
| Location label generic text | Matches session state; no false city names |
| conic-gradient unsupported | Fallback SVG arc remains |

---

## Final Verdict: **MORE FIXES REQUIRED**

### Blockers before READY

1. **iOS Safari + iOS PWA:** Confirm SOS hold loader visible for full hold duration.
2. **Responsive matrix:** Re-run layout audit at 320, 360, 375, 390, 393, 414 in light + dark on iOS Safari and Android Chrome.
3. **Park Me photos:** Capture post-fix screenshot for visual sign-off.

### Cleared for merge (code-complete)

- SOS auth bypass
- Shell background unification
- Park Me single-step photos
- Session-driven location labels
- Shared retake icon
- WebKit SOS loader implementation

Once the three blockers above pass on real devices, update verdict to **READY**.
