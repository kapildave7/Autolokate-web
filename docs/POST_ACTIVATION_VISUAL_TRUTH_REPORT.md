# Post-Activation PWA — Visual Truth Report

**Date:** 2026-06-18  
**Method:** Evidence-only audit — **no** implementation reports, **no** prior parity percentages  
**Sources:** Figma frame PNG exports (MCP `download_figma_images`) + live Playwright captures at **393×852 @2x dark**  
**Figma file:** `FtHCUnE0HH586PtG5yJyG0` · Section `843:2079`  
**Live app:** `http://127.0.0.1:5175`

## Methodology

### Scoring rule (strict)

Only **exact** visual matches count as pass. The following do **not** count:

- "Looks close"
- "Matches intent"
- "Uses same component"
- "Acceptable approximation"

Each screen is scored:

```
Parity % = (passed_checks / total_checks) × 100
```

Checks cover: layout structure, copy (exact string), typography hierarchy, spacing band (±4px at 393w), colors (hex from Figma vars), icons (glyph identity), illustrations/assets, component states, CTA label/width/position, animations (static frame comparison only).

### Exclusions

**None applied** in this audit. Figma frames include StatusBar and language picker where present — mismatches are counted as fails.

### Evidence artifacts

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| Figma screenshots (30) | `docs/audit-screenshots/figma/*.png` |
| Live screenshots (30) | `docs/audit-screenshots/live/*.png` |
| Side-by-side (30) | `docs/audit-screenshots/compare/*.png` |

Example side-by-side (Figma left · Live right):

## Executive summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Frames audited | **30 / 30** |
| Screenshots captured | **60** (30 Figma + 30 live) |
| Side-by-side pairs | **30** |
| **Overall parity (mean of 30 screens)** | **67%** |
| Screens ≥ 90% exact | **0** |
| Screens ≤ 50% exact | **7** |

**Verdict:** Implementation is **not** visually identical to Figma. Structural copy/timeline recovery is partial; **color system, hero assets, scanner entry frame, and several status/error screens remain materially wrong.**

## Final evidence-based score

**Overall Figma visual parity: 67%**

This is the unweighted mean of per-screen strict checklists against exported Figma frames and live captures. It is **not** an estimate from documentation.
