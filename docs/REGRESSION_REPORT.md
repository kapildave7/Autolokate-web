## Build verification

| Command | Result |
|---------|--------|
| `npm run build` | ✅ 12/12 packages, exit 0 |
| TypeScript (`tsc -p apps/onboarding`) | ✅ Passed via build |
| Linter (changed files) | ✅ No errors |

---

## Flow verification matrix

| # | Flow | Entry | Expected first route | Code path | Status |
|---|------|-------|----------------------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Purchase | `/journey` card 1 | `/journey/auth/mobile` | `dispatchPlatformFlow` → `selectActivationFlow('purchase')` | ✅ Preserved |
| 2 | Pre-Paid | `/journey` card 2 | `/journey/prepaid/welcome` | `dispatchPlatformFlow` → `selectActivationFlow('prepaid')` | ✅ Preserved |
| 3 | B2B2C | `/journey` card 3 | `/journey/b2b2c/welcome` | `dispatchPlatformFlow` → `selectActivationFlow('b2b2c')` | ✅ Preserved |
| 4 | Post-activation | `/journey` card 4 | `/pwa/scan/loading` | `dispatchPlatformFlow('postActivation')` → `pwaScanPaths.loading` | ✅ Preserved |

---

## Session verification

| Check | Before | After | Status |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| Journey storage key | `al-journey-v1` | `al-journey-v1` | ✅ Unchanged |
| PWA storage key | `al-pwa-scan-v1` | `al-pwa-scan-v1` | ✅ Unchanged |
| Selected flow key | `al-selected-flow` | `al-selected-flow` | ✅ Unchanged |
| JourneyProvider persistence logic | `persistence.ts` | Unmodified | ✅ |
| PwaScanProvider persistence logic | `pwa-scan-storage.ts` | Unmodified | ✅ |
| Cross-nav session loss | Journey persisted in storage when entering PWA | Same + journey context stays mounted | ✅ Improved |

---

## Provider verification

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| `useJourney()` API unchanged | ✅ |
| `usePwaScan()` API unchanged | ✅ |
| No double `PwaScanProvider` nesting | ✅ |
| JourneyProvider internals unchanged | ✅ |
| PwaScanProvider internals unchanged | ✅ |
| Both providers available on all routes | ✅ New (Phase 1 intent) |

---

## Navigation verification

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Route paths unchanged | ✅ |
| Redirects unchanged | ✅ |
| `journeyPaths.*` unchanged | ✅ |
| `pwaScanPaths.*` unchanged | ✅ |
| Guard wrappers unchanged | ✅ |
| `selectActivationFlow` unchanged | ✅ |
| `activation-routing.ts` unchanged | ✅ |

---

## UI verification

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| FlowEntryScreen — 4 cards, same labels | ✅ (from registry, same strings) |
| FlowEntryScreen — theme toggle | ✅ Unchanged |
| FlowHubScreen — QA buttons | ✅ Same behavior via dispatcher |
| No new screens | ✅ |
| No shell changes | ✅ |

---

## Business rules verification

| Rule | Status |
|------|--------|
| Purchase → auth → R03 path | ✅ Unchanged |
| Prepaid welcome → auth handoff | ✅ Unchanged |
| B2B2C welcome → auth handoff | ✅ Unchanged |
| `getPostAuthActivationPath` | ✅ Not modified |
| `getEmergencyHandoffPath` | ✅ Not modified |
| `RequireSelectedFlowMatch('purchase')` | ✅ Not modified |
| Post-activation: no `setSelectedFlow` on card 4 | ✅ Preserved (dispatcher navigates only) |

---

## Risk items explicitly NOT implemented

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Session merge | ❌ Not done (correct) |
| Route URL changes | ❌ Not done (correct) |
| QR route `/scan/:qrId` | ❌ Not done (correct) |
| Auth field unification | ❌ Not done (correct) |
| Guard changes | ❌ Not done (correct) |

---

## Known non-regressions / acceptable changes

| Change | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| PWA session hydrates at app boot on `/journey` only visits | Low — demo defaults, no user-visible change until PWA entered |
| Journey React context stays mounted during PWA flow | Positive — no context loss on cross-nav |

---

## Manual test checklist (recommended)

- [ ] `/journey` → Purchase → complete auth → R03
- [ ] `/journey` → Prepaid → welcome → activate → auth
- [ ] `/journey` → B2B2C → welcome → activate → auth
- [ ] `/journey` → Post-activation → loading → vehicle hub
- [ ] Return `/journey` after PWA — journey session intact
- [ ] `/journey/flow-hub` QA buttons still route correctly

*Automated E2E not run in this pass; static analysis + build green.*

---

## Final verdict

# SAFE UNIFIED PWA READY

No session loss, navigation regressions, provider regressions, or UI regressions identified in static verification. Build passes. All four flows preserve prior behavior via delegated dispatch.
