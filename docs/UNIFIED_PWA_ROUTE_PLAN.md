# Unified PWA Route Plan

**Date:** 2026-06-17  
**Scope:** Plan only — no implementation  
**Parent:** [UNIFIED_PWA_MIGRATION_AUDIT.md](./UNIFIED_PWA_MIGRATION_AUDIT.md)

---

## Objective

Define how to achieve **one route tree** for Autolokate PWA while preserving all existing paths, guards, redirects, and flow order for Purchase, Prepaid, B2B2C, Emergency, and PWA Scanner.

---

## Current route inventory

### Summary

| Tree | Prefix | Routes | Provider | Guard layer |
|------|--------|--------|----------|-------------|
| Journey | `/journey/*` | ~32 | JourneyProvider | `JourneyRouteGuards` |
| PWA | `/pwa/scan/*` | 30 | PwaScanProvider | Inline + `PwaPhotoRouteGuard` |
| Root | `/` | → `/journey` | JourneyProvider | — |

**Total:** ~62 active routes + redirects.

### Journey routes (frozen)

| Segment | Paths | Guard |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Entry | `/journey`, `/journey/home`, `/journey/flow-hub` | None |
| Auth | `/journey/auth/mobile`, `/otp`, `/vehicle-owner`, `/legal/*` | None (completion handler in wrapper) |
| Purchase | `/journey/purchase/r03-vehicle` … `r10c-payment-unconfirmed` | `RequireAuthCompleted` + `RequireSelectedFlowMatch('purchase')` |
| Prepaid | `/journey/prepaid/welcome` | None |
| B2B2C | `/journey/b2b2c/welcome`, `/welcome/plan-rider` | None |
| Emergency | `/journey/emergency/rider-prompt` … `contacts-summary` | `RequireAuthCompleted` + `RequireSelectedFlow` |
| Completed | `/journey/completed` | None |

### PWA routes (frozen)

| Segment | Paths | Guard |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Bootstrap | `/pwa/scan/loading` | None |
| Hub | `/pwa/scan/vehicle` | None |
| Verify | `/pwa/scan/verify/mobile`, `/otp`, `/name` | None |
| Park Me | `/pwa/scan/park-me/*` (11 routes) | Inline navigation guards |
| SOS | `/pwa/scan/sos/*` (14 routes) | Inline + photo guard |

---

## Target route architecture (phased)

### Phase R0 — Current (no change)

All paths unchanged. Documented in `SINGLE_PWA_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### Phase R1 — Single mount, legacy paths

One `Routes` tree; all existing URLs work identically.

```
BrowserRouter
└── AutolokateProvider
    └── Routes
        ├── /pwa/scan/*     → PwaScanRoutes (unchanged paths)
        └── /*              → JourneyRoutes (unchanged paths)
```

**Change:** Provider nesting only. **Zero URL change.**

### Phase R2 — Parallel aliases (additive)

New production-oriented paths alias to existing route components.

| New path (alias) | Resolves to | Component |
|------------------|-------------|-----------|
| `/scan/loading` | `/pwa/scan/loading` | `PwaLoadingRoute` |
| `/scan/vehicle` | `/pwa/scan/vehicle` | `PwaVehicleFoundRoute` |
| `/scan/verify/mobile` | `/pwa/scan/verify/mobile` | `PwaVerifyMobileRoute` |
| `/activate` | `/journey` | `FlowEntryScreen` (dev) or QR dispatch (prod) |
| `/activate/auth/mobile` | `/journey/auth/mobile` | `A1MobileScreen` via AuthRoutes |
| `/activate/purchase/r03-vehicle` | `/journey/purchase/r03-vehicle` | PurchaseRoutes |

**Rule:** Old paths remain permanently during R2. Redirects are **optional** and must not be one-way until telemetry confirms migration.

### Phase R3 — QR entry route (future)

| Path | Handler |
|------|---------|
| `/scan/:qrId` | Decode payload → dispatch to existing first screen |

Dispatch targets (unchanged logic):

| Payload type | First screen |
|--------------|--------------|
| `purchase` | `/journey/auth/mobile` (or alias) |
| `prepaid` | `/journey/prepaid/welcome` |
| `b2b2c` | `/journey/b2b2c/welcome` |
| `activated` | `/pwa/scan/loading` |

See [QR_ENTRY_STRATEGY.md](./QR_ENTRY_STRATEGY.md).

### Phase R4 — Owner post-activation routes (future, new screens)

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/dashboard` | Owner home after activation |
| `/emergency` | Owner emergency contact management |
| `/vehicle` | Vehicle + plan profile |
| `/profile` | Account settings |

**Note:** These are **new** routes, not renames of existing journey/PWA paths. No breaking change to current flows.

---

## Route ownership after unification

| Domain | Route owner file (future) | Path namespace |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Platform root | `platform/routes/AutolokateRoutes.tsx` | `/` |
| Activation entry | `journey/routes/JourneyRoutes.tsx` | `/journey/*`, `/activate/*` |
| Auth | `journey/routes/AuthRoutes.tsx` | `/journey/auth/*`, `/activate/auth/*` |
| Purchase | `journey/routes/PurchaseRoutes.tsx` | `/journey/purchase/*` |
| Prepaid | `journey/routes/PrepaidRoutes.tsx` | `/journey/prepaid/*` |
| B2B2C | `journey/routes/B2b2cRoutes.tsx` | `/journey/b2b2c/*` |
| Emergency setup | `journey/routes/EmergencyRoutes.tsx` | `/journey/emergency/*` |
| Scanner | `post-activation-pwa/routes/PwaScanRoutes.tsx` | `/pwa/scan/*`, `/scan/*` |
| QR dispatch | `platform/routes/QrDispatchRoute.tsx` (future) | `/scan/:qrId` |

**Principle:** Feature folders keep route **components**; platform layer owns **mount tree**.

---

## Path constant migration

### Current constants (must remain valid)

| File | Export |
|------|--------|
| `journey/constants.ts` | `journeyPaths` |
| `journey/auth/auth-routing.ts` | `authJourneyPaths` |
| `journey/purchase/purchase-routing.ts` | `purchaseJourneyPaths` |
| `journey/prepaid/prepaid-routing.ts` | `prepaidJourneyPaths` |
| `journey/b2b2c/b2b2c-routing.ts` | `b2b2cJourneyPaths` |
| `journey/emergency/emergency-routing.ts` | `emergencyJourneyPaths` |
| `post-activation-pwa/constants/pwa-scan-paths.ts` | `pwaScanPaths` |

### Future unified constants (additive)

```typescript
// Conceptual — future platform/routes/paths.ts
export const autolokatePaths = {
  // Legacy (permanent during migration)
  journey: journeyPaths,
  pwaScan: pwaScanPaths,

  // Production aliases
  scan: { loading: '/scan/loading', vehicle: '/scan/vehicle', ... },
  activate: { root: '/activate', auth: { mobile: '/activate/auth/mobile', ... } },

  // Owner post-activation (new)
  dashboard: '/dashboard',
  emergency: '/emergency',
  vehicle: '/vehicle',
  profile: '/profile',
};
```

**Rule:** All navigation inside feature code continues using `journeyPaths` / `pwaScanPaths` until explicit migration wave. Aliases are mounted at router level, not by rewriting every `navigate()` call at once.

---

## Guard plan

### Journey guards — unchanged scope

| Guard | Applies to | Must NOT apply to |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| `RequireAuthCompleted` | `/journey/purchase/*`, `/journey/emergency/*` | `/pwa/scan/*` |
| `RequireSelectedFlow` | `/journey/emergency/*` | `/pwa/scan/*` |
| `RequireSelectedFlowMatch('purchase')` | `/journey/purchase/*` | All other |

**Risk if unified tree wraps PWA under journey guards:** Bystander scan blocked at auth gate. **Mitigation:** Guard wrappers stay on activation route segments only.

### PWA guards — unchanged scope

| Guard | Applies to |
|-------|------------|
| `PwaPhotoRouteGuard` | Photo capture routes |
| Inline `Navigate` redirects | Park Me / SOS flow order |

### Future QR guard (additive)

| Guard | Applies to |
|-------|------------|
| `RequireValidQrPayload` | `/scan/:qrId` only |

---

## Redirect preservation

These redirects are load-bearing — must not change behavior:

| From | To | Reason |
|------|-----|--------|
| `/` | `/journey` | App entry |
| `/journey/purchase` | `/journey/purchase/r03-vehicle` | Purchase entry |
| `/journey/emergency` | `/journey/emergency/rider-prompt` | Emergency index |
| `/journey/auth/splash` | `/journey/auth/mobile` | Deprecated splash |
| `/pwa/scan/` | `/pwa/scan/loading` | PWA bootstrap |
| `/pwa/scan/*` (unknown) | `/pwa/scan/loading` | PWA fallback |
| `/journey/*` (unknown) | `/journey` | Journey fallback |

---

## Flow order preservation

Route unification must **not** reorder steps within flows.

### Purchase (13 steps after auth)

R03 → R04 → R04b → R05 → R06 → R07 → R08 → R08b → R08c → R09 → R09b → R10 → (R10b/R10c) → Emergency

### Prepaid

Welcome → Auth → Emergency handoff (via `getEmergencyHandoffPath`)

### B2B2C

Welcome → Auth → Emergency handoff

### Emergency suffix

R0 → R1 → R2 → R3 → R4 → E0 → E1 → E2 → E3 → E5 → Completed

### PWA Park Me

vehicle-number → looking-up → confirm → permissions → photos → review → status/*

### PWA SOS

sos → holding → allow-location → scene-photos → sending → help-received → dispatched → resolved

**Verification:** Route plan changes mount points only; `navigate()` targets in route files stay identical during R0–R2.

---

## Cross-boundary navigation

### Current

| From | To | Session effect |
|------|-----|----------------|
| `/journey` card 4 | `/pwa/scan/loading` | JourneyProvider unmounts; PWA mounts; both keys in storage |
| PWA SOS resolved | `/pwa/scan/vehicle` | Scanner only |
| Journey completed | `/journey` (home) | `clearJourney()` |

### After R1 (single mount)

| From | To | Session effect |
|------|-----|----------------|
| Same URLs | Same behavior | Both providers mounted; no unmount on cross-nav |

**Improvement:** Activation session stays in React context when entering PWA (still isolated by slice).

---

## Dev / QA impact

| Surface | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| `ScreenDevApp.tsx` | Dev screen registry uses journey paths — unchanged in R0–R2 |
| Visual capture scripts | Path-based URLs — aliases require duplicate captures or redirect following |
| `router/routes.schema.ts` | Catalog update for aliases (metadata only) |
| FlowHub QA | `/journey/flow-hub` — keep as dev-only |

---

## Migration phases summary

| Phase | URL change | Provider change | Risk |
|-------|------------|-----------------|------|
| R0 | None | None | 🟢 |
| R1 | None | Single mount | 🟢 |
| R2 | Additive aliases | None | 🟢 |
| R3 | `/scan/:qrId` additive | QR dispatch | 🟡 |
| R4 | New owner routes | New screens | 🟡 |
| R5 | Deprecate old URLs (optional) | Redirects | 🔴 |

**Do not execute R5** until full regression + external link audit.

---

## Route conflict resolution

| Conflict | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| `/scan/:qrId` vs `/scan/loading` | Static routes before param route: `/scan/loading` registered before `/scan/:qrId` |
| `/emergency` (future owner) vs `/journey/emergency/*` | Different namespaces: `/emergency` (owner app) vs `/journey/emergency/*` (activation suffix) — document clearly |
| Auth path duplication | Shared route elements; mode from route prefix or context |
| Wildcard fallbacks | Per-subtree wildcards preserved |

---

## Testing checklist (when implemented)

- [ ] Every `journeyPaths.*` URL resolves
- [ ] Every `pwaScanPaths.*` URL resolves
- [ ] Purchase guard blocks unauthenticated `/journey/purchase/r03-vehicle`
- [ ] PWA `/pwa/scan/vehicle` accessible without auth
- [ ] Flow order: purchase payment → emergency contacts-empty
- [ ] Flow order: prepaid Safe plan → E0 skip R0
- [ ] Flow order: PWA park-me deferred verify → resume after name
- [ ] All legacy redirects return 302/Navigate equivalent
- [ ] Dev entry 4 cards navigate correctly
- [ ] Unknown paths fall back correctly per subtree

## Verdict for route plan

| Phase | Verdict |
|-------|---------|
| R0 — no change | ✅ SAFE |
| R1 — single mount, same URLs | ✅ SAFE TO MERGE |
| R2 — parallel aliases | ✅ SAFE TO MERGE |
| R3 — QR dispatch route | ✅ SAFE TO MERGE (additive) |
| R4 — new owner routes | ✅ SAFE TO MERGE (additive) |
| R5 — remove legacy URLs | ❌ NOT SAFE TO MERGE without extended parallel period |
| Big-bang URL rename (no aliases) | ❌ NOT SAFE TO MERGE |

**Recommended:** R1 → R2 → R3 in sequence. Keep `/journey` and `/pwa/scan/*` permanently for dev/QA even after production QR entry.
