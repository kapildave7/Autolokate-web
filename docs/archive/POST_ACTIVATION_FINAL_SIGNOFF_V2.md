# Post-Activation PWA — Final Signoff V2

**Date:** 2026-06-18  
**Auditor:** Recovery sprint verification (code + Figma MCP + build)  
**Prior signoff:** `POST_ACTIVATION_FINAL_SIGNOFF.md` (~71%, NOT READY)  
**Recovery report:** `POST_ACTIVATION_PARITY_RECOVERY_REPORT.md`

## Executive summary

| Metric | Signoff v1 | Signoff v2 |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Frame route coverage | 30/30 | **30/30** ✅ |
| Overall Figma parity | ~71% | **~98%** |
| P0 blockers | 5 open | **0 open** ✅ |
| Dead-end branches | 2 | **0** ✅ |
| Build | PASS | **PASS** ✅ |

### Final verdict: **NOT READY**

Per rule: *Do not approve if parity is below 100%.* P0 blockers are closed; residual ~2% gaps remain on frame 09b review layout, component fill animations, and full responsive QA pass.

## P0 blocker re-check

| Blocker | v1 | v2 |
|---------|----|----|
| CC tracker fidelity (10–12, 19–21, 23) | FAIL | **PASS** — 6/10 steps, subtitles, amber halos |
| Park Me photos frame 09 | FAIL | **PASS** — stacked 160px cards, Send to owner |
| Unreachable photo-not-clear / couldn't-send | FAIL | **PASS** — demo paths wired |
| Vehicle found RC card | FAIL | **PASS** — `AlScannedVehicleCard` |
| QR scanner viewport | FAIL | **PASS** — camera + overlay on loading |

---

## High-severity gap re-check

| Area | v1 gap | v2 |
|------|--------|-----|
| Loading subtitle | Wrong copy | **Fixed** |
| SOS title / chip / 112 | Drift | **Fixed** |
| Help received title / cancel CTA | Drift | **Fixed** |
| Emergency hub icon | heart | **bell** |
| Photo icons | scan-line | **camera** |
| R04 Park Me copy | Purchase default | **Fixed** |
| Contacts-only frame 23 | Simplified timeline | **Fixed** (3-step Figma tracker) |
| GPS preview | Text only | **Improved** — stacked dashed box + map-pin |
| Frame 09b review | Not audited v1 | **Partial** — 2-col review grid remains |

## Component promotion signoff v2

| Component | v1 | v2 |
|-----------|----|----|
| AlDispatchTimeline | FAIL (~45%) | **~98%** |
| AlPhotoGrid | FAIL (~50%) | **~97%** |
| AlStatusTracker | PARTIAL | **~98%** |
| AlScannerHubCard | PARTIAL | **~99%** |
| AlScenePhotoCard | PARTIAL | **~96%** |
| AlSosHoldButton | PARTIAL | **~95%** |
| AlPermissionSheet | PASS | **PASS** |
| AlIncidentStatusHero | PARTIAL | **PARTIAL** |

**Component promotion:** NOT APPROVED (aggregate ~96%, target 100% per component).

## Regression checks

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `/journey/*` onboarding defaults | ✅ No regression |
| Isolated `/pwa/scan/*` session | ✅ |
| 30 routes mount | ✅ |
| TypeScript / Vite build | ✅ |
| New routes added | ✅ None |
| Journey order changed | ✅ None |

---

## QA status (recovery sprint)

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Build | PASS |
| P0 demo: Photo Fail branch | Code path verified |
| P0 demo: Network Fail branch | Code path verified |
| Console errors (build) | None |
| 320–414 responsive pass | **Not re-run** |
| Light theme all frames | **Not re-run** |
| All 30 frames visual spot-check | **Partial** (code + Figma diff) |

---

## Remaining work to reach 100%

1. Rebuild frame **09b** review using stacked filled `AlScenePhotoCard` cells.
2. Add component-level **photo capture success** and **vehicle lookup success** motion (no full-page animate).
3. Execute full QA matrix: 30 frames × branches × dark/light × 320/360/375/390/393/414.

---

## Comparison to v1

| v1 finding | v2 status |
|------------|-----------|
| ~71% parity | **~98%** (+27pp) |
| 5 P0 blockers | **0** |
| 2 dead routes | **0** |
| Generic timeline | Figma-faithful CC tracker |
| Wrong photo layout | Stacked Figma 09 |
| READY claim rejected | Still **NOT READY** until 100% |

---

## Signoff authority

**NOT READY for production release** until remaining ~2% gaps close and full QA matrix passes.

Next gate: frame 09b parity + responsive QA + motion intents → target **100%** → READY.
