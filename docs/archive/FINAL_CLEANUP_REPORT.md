## Constraints Honored

- ❌ Journey architecture — not changed
- ❌ Business rules / plan limits — not changed
- ❌ Session schema — not changed
- ❌ Route order / flow order — not changed
- ❌ Payment outcomes / emergency logic — not changed
- ❌ Figma-approved UX — not changed

## Remaining Gaps (P2)

1. Icon inline SVGs in `@autolokate/ui` → migrate to `@autolokate/icons`
2. AuthStepShell / FlowStepShell base extraction
3. PWA loading status body composition
4. `@autolokate/utils` package unused at runtime
5. PR01–PR03 prepaid dev screens (dev catalog only)
6. purchase-activation deprecated screens (dev catalog only)
7. Route guard catalog/schema alignment (documented, not changed)

## Files Touched Summary

| Category | Count |
|----------|------:|
| Deleted directories | 16 |
| Deleted files | 3 |
| Modified (imports/cleanup) | ~70 |
| New files | 2 (`shared/format-mobile.ts`, tsconfig paths) |
| Deliverable docs | 10 |

## Verdict

**Cleanup complete.** Repository is leaner, imports are consistent, and all quality gates pass with no production flow regressions.
