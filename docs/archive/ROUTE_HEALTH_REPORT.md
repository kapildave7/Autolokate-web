# Route Health Report

**Date:** 2026-06-20  
**Source:** Code-verified audit of mounted routes (not implementation docs)  
**Constraint:** Guard logic not modified — gaps documented only

## Mount Tree

```
/ → /journey
/pwa/scan/* → PwaScanRoutes (no JourneyProvider)
* → JourneyProvider → JourneyRoutes
```

## Flow Summary

| Flow | Entry | Guards (runtime) | Terminal |
|------|-------|------------------|----------|
| **Purchase** | `/journey` → auth → R03 | `RequireAuthCompleted` + `RequireSelectedFlowMatch('purchase')` | R10/R10b/R10c → Emergency |
| **Prepaid** | `/journey/prepaid/welcome` | None | Emergency → Completed |
| **B2B2C** | `/journey/b2b2c/welcome` | None | Emergency → Completed |
| **Emergency** | Post-activation handoff | `RequireAuthCompleted` + `RequireSelectedFlow` | `/journey/completed` |
| **Auth** | `/journey/auth/*` | None (entry) | → flow-specific next step |
| **PWA** | `/pwa/scan/loading` | None (isolated session) | Status screens → vehicle hub |
| **Completed** | Emergency E5/R4 continue | **None** | Finish → `/journey` |

---

## Guards Inventory

| Guard | Mounted On |
|-------|------------|
| `RequireAuthCompleted` | `/journey/purchase/*`, `/journey/emergency/*` |
| `RequireSelectedFlowMatch('purchase')` | `/journey/purchase/*` |
| `RequireSelectedFlow` | `/journey/emergency/*` |
| `PwaPhotoRouteGuard` | PWA photo routes (diagnostic only — not access control) |

**Not mounted:** Declarative catalog guards in `routes.schema.ts`

## Per-Flow Findings

### Purchase ✅ (guarded)

- Entry: Auth complete → R03
- Session guards inside `PurchaseRoutes.tsx` for payment resume, vehicle state
- Back navigation wired per screen
- `redirectIfPaymentSucceeded` active R03–R09b
- **P2:** R04b lacks plate prerequisite redirect
- **P2:** Auth re-entry possible after purchase complete

### Prepaid ⚠️

- **P1:** No auth/flow guard on welcome — deep link possible
- **P1:** Schema path `/journey/prepaid/entry` vs mounted `/journey/prepaid/welcome`
- **P2:** PR01–PR03 screens exist but unreachable

### B2B2C ⚠️

- **P1:** Same unguarded welcome as prepaid
- **P1:** Schema `partner-bridge` vs mounted `welcome`
- **P2:** `welcome/plan-rider` orphan from flow entry

### Emergency ⚠️

- Parent guards correct
- **P1:** R1–R3, E2–E3 reachable without session prerequisites
- **P1:** Authed + no-flow recovery → purchase R03 (not flow entry)
- Back navigation comprehensive via `getEmergencyFlowBackPath`

### Post-Activation PWA ⚠️

- Isolated from journey — by design
- **P1:** Deep link to verify OTP/name bypasses mobile prerequisite
- **P1:** Deep link to Park Me bypasses verify gate
- **P2:** SOS holding refresh loses `location.state`
- **P2:** `/pwa/scan/park-me/review` legacy redirect
- **P2:** PWA paths absent from `routes.schema.ts`

### Auth ✅

- OTP/vehicle-owner prerequisite redirects active
- **P2:** No block on re-entry when auth already complete
- **P2:** Schema `/shared/*` legacy — actual mount is `/journey/auth/*`

### Flow Entry ✅

- `/journey`, `/journey/flow-hub` (QA), redirects for `/journey/home`, `/journey/qr-scan`
- **P1:** `/activate/:token` in schema — not mounted

### Completed ⚠️

- **P1:** No auth/completion guard — directly reachable
- **P2:** Incorrect schema stepId mapping

## Schema Drift Summary

| Schema Path | Mounted? |
|-------------|----------|
| `/activate/:token` | ❌ |
| `/shared/*` | ❌ (use `/journey/auth/*`) |
| `/prepaid/pr01–pr03` | ❌ |
| `/flow/*` | ❌ |
| `/journey/prepaid/entry` | ❌ (use `welcome`) |
| `/journey/b2b2c/partner-bridge` | ❌ (use `welcome`) |
| `/pwa/scan/*` | ✅ (not in schema) |

---

## Refresh / Session Behavior

| Store | Key | Survives Refresh |
|-------|-----|------------------|
| Journey session | `sessionStorage` `al-journey-v1` | ✅ Same tab |
| Selected flow | `localStorage` `al-selected-flow` | ✅ Cross-tab |
| Journey phase | In-memory only | ❌ Self-heals via route segment effects |
| PWA session | `sessionStorage` `al-pwa-scan-v1` | ✅ Same tab |

---

## Risk Rollup

| Priority | Count | Theme |
|----------|------:|-------|
| P0 | 0 | No total flow breakage in mounted routers |
| P1 | 12 | Unguarded routes, schema drift, deep links |
| P2 | 15+ | Legacy catalog, phase non-persistence, QA routes |

---

## Verdict

**PASS for demo flows** — all primary happy paths work with guards on purchase/emergency. **READY WITH KNOWN GAPS** for production hardening of deep links and schema alignment.
