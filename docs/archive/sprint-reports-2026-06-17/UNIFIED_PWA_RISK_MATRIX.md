## Conflict matrix by dimension

### Session conflicts

| Field / concept | Journey location | PWA location | Merge type | Rating |
|-----------------|------------------|--------------|------------|--------|

| Geo location | — | `session.location` | PWA only | 🟢 |
| Pending flow | — | `session.pendingFlow` | PWA only | 🟢 |
| Bootstrap gate | — | `session.bootstrapComplete` | PWA only | 🟢 |

### Route conflicts

| Conflict | Affected flows | Rating | Mitigation |
|----------|----------------|--------|------------|
| Provider unmount on `/journey` → `/pwa/scan` | All (cross-nav) | 🟡 | Root provider always mounted |
| Duplicate auth routes | PWA verify | 🟡 | Shared route component, mode param |
| Duplicate emergency namespaces | Journey + PWA | 🔴 | Keep slices: `/emergency/setup` vs `/scan/sos` |
| Journey wildcard → `/journey` | Activation | 🟡 | Preserve fallback during alias phase |
| PWA wildcard → `/loading` | Scanner | 🟡 | Preserve fallback during alias phase |
| `RequireSelectedFlowMatch` on PWA | Scanner | 🔴 | PWA routes must never inherit journey guards |
| Purchase payment mount guards | Purchase | 🟡 | Keep in route components unchanged |

### Provider conflicts

| Conflict | Consumers | Rating | Mitigation |
|----------|-----------|--------|------------|
| `useJourney()` throws outside provider | 15+ files | 🟡 | Compat shim hook |
| `usePwaScan()` throws outside provider | 8+ files | 🟡 | Compat shim hook |
| Different `updateSession` signatures | All | 🟡 | Unified API with overload |
| PWA `storageError` not in journey | PWA photos | 🟢 | Keep on scanner slice |
| `clearJourney` vs `resetSession` | Entry + completed | 🟡 | Explicit `resetMode()` API |

### State conflicts

| State | Journey | PWA | Rating |
|-------|---------|-----|--------|
| OTP input during verify | Session (A2 route) | Local `useState` | 🟡 |
| Resend cooldown | Session/route | Local `useState` | 🟢 |
| Payment processing | `session.purchase.paymentStatus` | — | 🟢 |
| Rider draft | `session.emergency.rider` | — | 🟢 |
| SOS hold timer | — | Route-local + `sosStatus` | 🟢 |
| Photo capture errors | — | `storageError` | 🟢 |

## Flow-specific risk summary

### Purchase

| Risk | Severity | Trigger |
|------|----------|---------|
| `RequireSelectedFlowMatch('purchase')` bypass | 🔴 | PWA mounted under same guards |
| Payment state cleared by scanner reset | 🔴 | Shared naive session reset |
| Auth incomplete access to R03 | 🔴 | `authStatus` not preserved |
| Route rename breaks R03–R10 deep links | 🟡 | URL unification without aliases |

### Prepaid

| Risk | Severity | Trigger |
|------|----------|---------|
| Entitlement seed lost | 🔴 | Session merge overwrites `prepaid` slice |
| Welcome skip breaks handoff | 🟡 | QR dispatch bypasses welcome incorrectly |
| `getEmergencyHandoffPath` wrong | 🔴 | `session.purchase` seed corrupted |

### B2B2C

| Risk | Severity | Trigger |
|------|----------|---------|
| Variant (`plan-only` / `plan-rider`) lost | 🔴 | Session merge |
| Back-nav from emergency wrong | 🟡 | `getEmergencyFlowBackPath` depends on `selectedFlow` + riderCount |
| Same entitlement risks as prepaid | 🔴 | Shared b2b-shared seed path |

### Emergency (journey)

| Risk | Severity | Trigger |
|------|----------|---------|
| Rider/contact data lost | 🔴 | Session overwrite from PWA |
| Guard bypass (unauthenticated) | 🔴 | Provider/guard refactor |
| Handoff path wrong after auth | 🔴 | `activation-routing.ts` inputs change |

### PWA Scanner

| Risk | Severity | Trigger |
|------|----------|---------|
| Photos lost on session merge | 🔴 | Schema migration without photo store |
| Quota errors in activation | 🔴 | Photos inline in unified key |
| `pendingFlow` resume broken | 🔴 | Field rename or loss |
| Bystander name shown as owner | 🔴 | Auth field unification |
| Verify flow broken | 🟡 | Auth orchestrator refactor |
| Demo vehicle seed lost | 🟡 | `defaultPwaScanSession()` hydration change |

## Mitigation priority

| Priority | Action | Resolves |
|----------|--------|----------|
| P0 | Namespaced session slices — never flat merge | #14, #15, #16, #17, #18 |
| P0 | Separate photo storage (IndexedDB or `al-pwa-photos-v1`) | #18 |
| P0 | Preserve `selectedFlow` + guards for activation routes | #19, #20 |
| P1 | Root provider with `useJourney` / `usePwaScan` shims | #21, provider conflicts |
| P1 | Auth mode discriminator (`owner` \| `bystander`) | #15 |
| P2 | Route aliases for all 62 paths | Route conflicts |
| P2 | Unified shell with mode prop | Shell merge |
| P3 | QR dispatch (additive, no session merge) | Entry unification |

## Final verdict

# NOT SAFE TO MERGE (big-bang)

**Blockers (must not proceed without plan):**

1. Single session key with inline photos  
2. Unified auth field namespace (owner/bystander)  
3. Unified emergency state (setup vs dispatch)  
4. Flat vehicle model  
5. Removal of `selectedFlow` / journey guards  
6. Simultaneous provider swap without compat hooks  

**Safe to proceed independently:**

- QR dispatch layer  
- Route aliases  
- Provider compat layer (phased)  
- Session slice schema with photo extraction (phased)
