# Rider Loop Fix Report

**Date:** 2026-06-17  
**Sprint:** P0 iOS Contact Picker + Rider Loop + iOS Install  
**Status:** FIXED

---

## Problem

After skipping the rider prompt (R0), adding an emergency contact, and continuing from E5 (contacts summary), the app could **reopen the rider flow** — especially on **Purchase** plans with rider entitlement.

---

## Root cause

1. **`getContactsSummaryRiderContext`** treated Purchase differently:
   - `blockedBySkip = riderSkipped && flow !== 'purchase'`
   - Purchase skip did **not** block rider re-entry on E5 Continue

2. **`E5Route` `useLayoutEffect`** cleared `riderSkipped` on Purchase when riders were still owed:
   - Reset skip flag → `shouldEnterRiderFlowOnContinue` became true → loop

3. **`EmergencyWildcardRedirect`** always sent users to `rider-prompt` unless purchase payment success — ignored `riderSkipped`

4. **`R0Route`** did not guard against re-entry when `riderSkipped === true`

---

## Fix

| Location | Change |
|----------|--------|
| `emergency-limits.ts` | `shouldEnterRiderFlowOnContinue = ridersOwed && !riderSkipped` for **all flows** |
| `EmergencyRoutes.tsx` E5 | Removed `useLayoutEffect` that reset `riderSkipped` |
| `EmergencyRoutes.tsx` R0 | Redirect to E0 when `riderSkipped` |
| `EmergencyRoutes.tsx` wildcard | Redirect to E0 when `riderSkipped` or no rider entitlement |

**Unchanged business rules:**
- R0 skip still sets `riderSkipped: true`
- Rider remains optional
- User can still add riders later from E5 if they did **not** skip (via `goToRiderSetup`)

## Flow verification

| Flow | Plan | Skip rider → add contact → E5 Continue | Expected |
|------|------|----------------------------------------|----------|
| Purchase | Secure/Shield + rider | Yes | → `/journey/completed` |
| Prepaid | Plan + rider | Yes | → completed |
| B2B2C | plan-rider | Yes | → completed |
| Purchase | Secure + rider | No skip, riders owed | → R0/R1 rider setup |

| Back navigation after skip | Expected |
|----------------------------|----------|
| E0 Back | Flow back (R10 for purchase) — not R0 |
| E5 Back | E0 contacts-empty |

---

## Verdict

**FIXED** — `riderSkipped` is honoured across Purchase, Prepaid, and B2B2C. No rider loop after explicit skip.
