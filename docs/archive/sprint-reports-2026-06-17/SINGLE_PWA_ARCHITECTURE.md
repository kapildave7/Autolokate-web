# Single PWA Architecture

**Product:** Autolokate PWA  
**Date:** 2026-06-17  
**Status:** Architecture definition — **no code, route, session, or business-rule changes in this document**

---

## Executive summary

Autolokate is **one Progressive Web App**, not four separate apps. The four consumer journeys are **modules with distinct entry paths**, sharing auth, design system, UI primitives, and (within activation) a unified journey session.

| What it is | What it is not |
|------------|----------------|
| One deployable PWA (`apps/onboarding`) | Four separate products |
| One platform, multiple entry journeys | Separate architectures per flow |
| Shared auth + shared UI + shared design tokens | Isolated design systems |

**Deployable artifact:** `@autolokate/onboarding` — Vite + React 19 + React Router 7.

## Product definition

### Autolokate PWA modules

| # | Module name | Dev entry card | Runtime entry |
|---|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | Consumer QR Activation + Purchase | Card 1 on `/journey` | `/journey` → auth → `/journey/purchase/*` |
| 2 | Consumer QR Activation — B2B (Pre-Paid) | Card 2 on `/journey` | `/journey` → `/journey/prepaid/welcome` → auth |
| 3 | Consumer QR Activation — B2B2C | Card 3 on `/journey` | `/journey` → `/journey/b2b2c/welcome` → auth |
| 4 | QR Scan (Post-Activation) | Card 4 on `/journey` | `/pwa/scan/loading` (leaves journey context) |

All four cards remain on **`/journey`** (`FlowEntryScreen`). UX, navigation, and card labels are unchanged.

---

## Current architecture (Phase 1 — live)

Phase 1 is **frozen**: routes, guards, redirects, session schema, and orchestration behave exactly as implemented today.

### Top-level router split

```
main.tsx
  └── JourneyOrchestrator
        ├── /pwa/scan/*     → PwaScanRoutes + PwaScanProvider  (isolated)
        └── *               → JourneyRoutes + JourneyProvider  (activation journeys)
```

**File:** `apps/onboarding/src/journey/JourneyOrchestrator.tsx`

Post-activation PWA is mounted **outside** `JourneyProvider`. Journey session does not leak into PWA and vice versa.

### Route map (unchanged)

#### Journey root

| Path | Screen / behavior |
|------|-------------------|
| `/` | → `/journey` |
| `/journey` | `FlowEntryScreen` — 4 entry cards |
| `/journey/auth/*` | Shared auth (A1 → A2 → A3) |
| `/journey/purchase/*` | Purchase R03–R10 |
| `/journey/prepaid/*` | Pre-paid welcome |
| `/journey/b2b2c/*` | Partner welcome |
| `/journey/emergency/*` | Rider + emergency contacts |
| `/journey/completed` | Activation complete |

#### Post-activation PWA

| Path prefix | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `/pwa/scan/loading` | Bootstrap |
| `/pwa/scan/vehicle` | Scanned vehicle hub |
| `/pwa/scan/verify/*` | Bystander identity (mobile → OTP → name) |
| `/pwa/scan/park-me/*` | Park Me flow |
| `/pwa/scan/sos/*` | SOS emergency flow |

**Path constants:** `apps/onboarding/src/features/post-activation-pwa/constants/pwa-scan-paths.ts`

### Journey orchestration (unchanged)

Runtime navigation is **imperative** via React Router + route components. A declarative flow registry exists as catalog metadata (`apps/onboarding/src/flow/registry/`) but is not the runtime engine.

**Key orchestration files:**

| Concern | Path |
|---------|------|
| Journey context + session | `apps/onboarding/src/journey/JourneyContext.tsx` |
| Flow selection from entry | `apps/onboarding/src/journey/navigation/select-activation-flow.ts` |
| Post-auth routing | `apps/onboarding/src/journey/activation-routing.ts` |
| Route guards | `apps/onboarding/src/journey/guards/JourneyRouteGuards.tsx` |
| Auth completion wrapper | `apps/onboarding/src/journey/routes/JourneySharedAuthRoute.tsx` |

**Flow selection behavior (preserved):**

| Card | Action |
|------|--------|
| Purchase | `setSelectedFlow('purchase')` → `/journey/auth/mobile` |
| Pre-Paid | Navigate `/journey/prepaid/welcome` (flow set on welcome CTA) |
| B2B2C | Navigate `/journey/b2b2c/welcome` (flow set on welcome CTA) |
| Post-Activation | Navigate `/pwa/scan/loading` — no journey session mutation |

### Session model (unchanged)

Two isolated session stores — **by design in Phase 1**:

| Store | Key | Provider | Schema |
|-------|-----|----------|--------|
| Journey | `sessionStorage` → `al-journey-v1` | `JourneyProvider` | `apps/onboarding/src/journey/types.ts` |
| PWA scan | `sessionStorage` → `al-pwa-scan-v1` | `PwaScanProvider` | `apps/onboarding/src/features/post-activation-pwa/context/pwa-scan-types.ts` |

Selected flow persists in `localStorage` → `al-selected-flow`.

**No schema changes are proposed in Phase 1 or this architecture pass.**

### Shared pipeline (all activation journeys)

Every QR activation journey shares the same auth suffix:

```
shared.mobile → shared.otp → shared.account (vehicle owner)
```

Defined in `apps/onboarding/src/flow/registry/config/shared-pipeline.config.ts`.

Post-auth paths diverge by `selectedFlow` via `getPostAuthActivationPath()` in `activation-routing.ts`.

---

## Future architecture (Phase 2 — document only)

**Not implemented.** Phase 2 defines a **conceptual unified route tree** for when QR becomes the primary entry and activation/post-activation merge under one platform shell.

### Proposed top-level routes

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/activate` | Unified activation entry (replaces manual `/journey` card selection in production) |
| `/scan/:qrId` | QR decode + journey dispatch |
| `/dashboard` | Post-activation home (vehicle status, quick actions) |
| `/emergency` | Emergency contacts + rider management (owner-facing) |
| `/vehicle` | Vehicle profile, plan, RC |
| `/profile` | Account, settings, legal |

### Relationship to Phase 1 routes

| Phase 1 (current) | Phase 2 (future mapping) |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| `/journey` (dev entry) | Retained for development; production uses `/scan/:qrId` or `/activate` |
| `/journey/auth/*` | Absorbed into `/activate/*` or query-param journey context |
| `/journey/purchase/*` | `/activate/purchase/*` or journey slug under `/activate` |
| `/journey/prepaid/*`, `/journey/b2b2c/*` | `/activate/prepaid/*`, `/activate/b2b2c/*` |
| `/journey/emergency/*` | `/emergency/*` (owner setup) |
| `/journey/completed` | `/dashboard` or `/activate/complete` |
| `/pwa/scan/*` | `/scan/:qrId/*` (bystander / post-activation) |

Exact URL shapes are **TBD at implementation time**. Phase 2 preserves **flow order and business rules**; only the URL namespace and entry mechanism change.

---

## Migration path

### Phase 1 → Phase 2 (when implemented)

| Step | Action | Risk level |
|------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Introduce QR payload parser + journey router service | Medium — new entry path |
| 2 | Add `/scan/:qrId` route alongside existing `/pwa/scan/*` | Low — parallel mount |
| 3 | Map QR payload types to existing `selectActivationFlow()` / PWA bootstrap | Medium — must preserve handoff logic |
| 4 | Introduce `/activate` shell wrapping existing journey route trees | Medium — URL redirects needed |
| 5 | Unify session (optional) — journey + PWA under one provider with namespaced slices | **High** — schema coupling |
| 6 | Deprecate `/journey` as production entry; keep for dev/QA | Low |
| 7 | Add `/dashboard`, `/vehicle`, `/profile` as post-activation owner surfaces | Medium — new screens |

**Recommended sequencing:** Steps 1–4 can ship without session unification. Step 5 is optional and should not block QR entry.

### What must not change during migration

- Step order within each journey (auth → activation → emergency)
- Business rules (plan/rider entitlement, emergency handoff, payment gates)
- Guard semantics (`RequireAuthCompleted`, `RequireSelectedFlowMatch`)
- Session field names and persistence keys (until an explicit schema migration)

## Dependencies

### Monorepo packages (shared platform layer)

```
@autolokate/design-system  ← theme.css, tokens, interaction reset
@autolokate/ui             ← AlButton, AlOtpInput, shells, cards
@autolokate/icons          ← icon glyphs
@autolokate/brand          ← logo assets
@autolokate/auth           ← OTP auth client
@autolokate/api-client     ← API integration
@autolokate/hooks          ← shared hooks
@autolokate/types          ← shared types
@autolokate/utils          ← validation, formatting
```

All feature modules in `apps/onboarding/src/features/` depend on `@autolokate/ui` and `@autolokate/design-system`.

### In-app module dependencies

```
FlowEntryScreen (/journey)
  ├── purchase  → JourneyProvider → shared-auth → purchase → emergency → completed
  ├── prepaid   → prepaid welcome → JourneyProvider → shared-auth → emergency → completed
  ├── b2b2c     → partner welcome → JourneyProvider → shared-auth → emergency → completed
  └── post-act  → PwaScanProvider (isolated, reuses auth UI components only)

b2b-shared
  └── seeds session.purchase + session.vehicle for prepaid/b2b2c emergency handoff

activation-routing
  └── post-auth path resolution (purchase R03 vs emergency handoff)
```

### External dependencies

| Dependency | Used by |
|------------|---------|
| React Router 7 | All routing |
| sessionStorage / localStorage | Journey + PWA persistence |
| Figma design tokens | `@autolokate/design-system` |

## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Dual session stores** (journey vs PWA) | User state lost when crossing `/journey` ↔ `/pwa/scan` | Phase 2 session unification plan; until then, treat as intentional isolation |
| **Imperative routing vs flow registry drift** | Registry docs diverge from runtime | Registry is catalog-only; runtime routes are source of truth for Phase 1 |
| **QR entry without payload spec** | Wrong journey dispatch | Define payload schema before Phase 2 implementation (see `QR_ENTRY_STRATEGY.md`) |
| **URL migration breaking bookmarks** | Production links break | Parallel routes + redirects during Phase 2 rollout |
| **Session schema merge** | Data loss or guard regressions | Keep schemas separate until explicit migration; namespaced slices preferred over merge |
| **Dev entry vs production entry divergence** | QA tests wrong entry path | Keep `/journey` cards permanently for dev; document production entry separately |
