# Final Release Sign-Off

**Date:** 2026-06-21  
**Build target:** `https://onboarding-lemon-six.vercel.app`  
**Evidence report:** `REAL_DEVICE_EVIDENCE_REPORT.md`  
**Prior code reports:** `REAL_DEVICE_SIGNOFF_V2.md`, `IOS_INSTALL_REPORT.md`, `IOS_CONTACT_PICKER_REPORT.md`, `RIDER_LOOP_FIX_REPORT.md`

## Final Verdict

# ISSUES FOUND

# NOT RELEASE READY

---

## Summary

Real-device verification **was not executed** in this sign-off session. No screenshots, videos, device names, OS versions, or browser versions were captured for any item in the required device matrix.

Code-level fixes from the P0 sprint may be present in the production bundle (remote static check only). **Runtime behaviour on Android Chrome, Samsung Internet, iPhone Safari, and iPhone Chrome is unverified.**

## Release gate checklist

| Gate | Required | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Android Chrome — install + standalone | Device evidence | ❌ **FAIL** — not run |
| Samsung Internet — install + flows | Device evidence | ❌ **FAIL** — not run |
| iPhone Safari — A2HS + SOS/camera/geo | Device evidence | ❌ **FAIL** — not run |
| iPhone Chrome — install UX (no Android banner) | Device evidence | ❌ **FAIL** — not run |
| Emergency contact — native picker (Android) | Device evidence | ❌ **FAIL** — not run |
| Emergency contact — iOS fallback | Device evidence | ❌ **FAIL** — not run |
| Rider skip — Purchase / Prepaid / B2B2C | Device evidence | ❌ **FAIL** — not run |
| Visual QA 393px dark/light | Device evidence | ❌ **FAIL** — not run |
| Evidence artifacts in repo | Screenshots + video | ❌ **FAIL** — none |

**Passed:** 0 / 9 gates  
**Failed:** 9 / 9 gates

## Blockers before RELEASE READY

### P0 — Must have device evidence

1. **Install matrix** — Execute TEST 1–3 on all four browsers; attach recordings of standalone launch and theme/session persistence.
2. **Contact flow** — Execute TEST 4 on Android Chrome (native picker) and iPhone Safari (documented fallback); attach before/after prefilled field screenshots.
3. **Rider skip** — Execute TEST 5 for Purchase, Prepaid, and B2B2C; screen-record path from R0 skip through `/journey/completed` with no R0 re-entry.
4. **Visual QA** — Execute TEST 6 at 393px width in dark and light; attach screenshots for consent, OTP, spacing, input active state.

### P1 — Process

5. Store evidence under `docs/real-device-evidence/` with naming: `{date}-{device}-{browser}-{test-id}.png|mp4`
6. Update `REAL_DEVICE_EVIDENCE_REPORT.md` with PASS/FAIL per row and links to artifacts
7. Re-run this sign-off only after evidence is attached

## Prior code reports — status reclassification

| Report | Code claim | Device sign-off |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| `IOS_CONTACT_PICKER_REPORT.md` | Implemented | **UNVERIFIED** on hardware |
| `RIDER_LOOP_FIX_REPORT.md` | Implemented | **UNVERIFIED** on hardware |
| `IOS_INSTALL_REPORT.md` | Implemented | **UNVERIFIED** on hardware |
| `REAL_DEVICE_SIGNOFF_V2.md` | FIXED (code) | **Still pending** device QA |

These reports describe **intent and code changes**, not **release proof**.

---

## Recommended next step

1. Deploy latest build to Vercel (if not already)
2. Run the manual checklist in `REAL_DEVICE_SIGNOFF_V2.md` on physical devices
3. Capture and commit evidence artifacts
4. Request re-sign-off with `REAL_DEVICE_EVIDENCE_REPORT.md` updated to PASS rows
