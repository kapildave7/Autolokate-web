*Static code-path verification. Manual browser E2E recommended.*

## CF-01: Purchase → Completed → Go home → PWA

1. Purchase card → auth → purchase → emergency → `/journey/completed`
2. "Go to home" → `clearJourney()` + `/journey` (intentional journey clear)
3. PWA card → `/pwa/scan/loading` (no journey writes)
4. Providers mounted throughout ✅

---

## CF-03: PWA → Home → Purchase

1. User in `/pwa/scan/*` — PWA session active
2. Return to `/journey` via browser back or URL — no provider unmount ✅
3. Purchase card → `setSelectedFlow('purchase')` + `/journey/auth/mobile`
4. PWA session untouched ✅

**Note:** No in-app home link in PWA routes (pre-existing).

---

## Route regression

All `/journey/*` and `/pwa/scan/*` paths unchanged. Guards unchanged. Dispatcher delegates to same navigation targets as pre-Phase-1.

---

## UI regression

Entry screen labels, theme toggle, shells, and flow screens unchanged.

---

## Build

```
npm run build — 12/12 pass
Bundle: 1,083.68 kB JS (gzip 275.81 kB), ~+0.8 kB vs pre-Phase-1
```

---

## Issues found

**None blocking.**

| ID | Info |
|----|------|
| INFO-01 | Dual session by design — slices independent |
| INFO-02 | `clearJourney` only on completed "Go to home" |
| INFO-03 | Dev preview uses standalone JourneyProvider |

---

## Final verdict

# VERIFIED

No cross-flow regressions from Phase 1. Provider stable. No unexpected redirects.
