| Constraint | Honoured |
|------------|----------|
| No routing changes | ✅ Same paths; guard redirects only |

| No business rule changes | ✅ Limits, OTP, plans unchanged |
| Use `@autolokate/ui` sheet | ✅ `AlPermissionSheet` |

## Device QA note

Code complete and build verified. Physical device matrix (Android Chrome, iPhone Safari/Chrome, PWA standalone) should confirm:

- iOS E0 shows **Enter mobile number** only
- Android E0 shows **Add from contacts** + native picker
- R0 skip → confirmation → completed with no loop

See `REAL_DEVICE_EVIDENCE_REPORT.md` for hardware evidence requirements before release marketing.
