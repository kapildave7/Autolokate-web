# React Architecture Report

**Date:** 2026-06-20 (Consolidation Pass)

---

## Architecture (unchanged — by constraint)

```
BrowserRouter
├── /pwa/scan/* → PwaScanProvider → PwaScanRoutes
└── * → JourneyProvider → JourneyRoutes
```

No journey architecture, route order, flow order, or guard logic changes.

---

## Component Structure

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| Route files | Thin orchestrators — session read/write + navigation |
| Screen components | Presentation + local form state |
| Compositions | Reusable domain UI (PurchaseStatusShell, EmptyStateHero) |
| `@autolokate/ui` | Generic Figma primitives |
| Hooks | Side effects isolated (geolocation, photo capture, hold progress) |

---

## Context Usage ✅

- `JourneyProvider` — single session blob for activation flows
- `PwaScanProvider` — isolated PWA session (no journey bleed)
- No context abuse; no derived UI state in providers

---

## Effect Quality (from prior hardening pass)

| Fix | Status |
|-----|--------|
| PurchaseRoutes stable deps | ✅ |
| Geolocation unmount guard | ✅ |
| SOS hold timer refs | ✅ |
| Park Me auto-locate ref gate | ✅ |

No setState-in-render. Timer cleanup verified in route effects.

## Cleanup Impact on React Tree

| Change | React impact |
|--------|--------------|
| Deleted orphan screens | Smaller dev catalog; production tree unchanged |
| Mobile formatter consolidation | Pure function imports — no component changes |
| `@/` import aliases | No runtime change |
| ScreenDevApp cleanup | Dev-only — no production render path change |

---

## Remaining P2 (not changed)

- AuthStepShell / FlowStepShell base extraction (~400 lines overlap)
- PWA loading status body extraction (3 routes)
- Error boundary → external reporting (Sentry)

---

## Verdict

**PASS** — Clean React architecture maintained. Consolidation reduced dead code without altering production component tree or flow behavior.
