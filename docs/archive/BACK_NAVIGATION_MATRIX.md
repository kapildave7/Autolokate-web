# Back Navigation Matrix

**Date:** 2026-06-19  
**Method:** Static route handler audit — all `onBack` / `navigate()` back targets  
**Constraint:** No `navigate(-1)` in codebase (explicit paths only)

---

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|------:|
| Routes with back affordance | **~52** |
| Routes without back (terminal/spinner) | **~13** |
| Navigation bugs found | **1** |
| Navigation bugs fixed | **1** |
| Loops (intentional) | **1** (SOS leave confirm) |

---

## Fix Applied

| Route | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Auth A1 Mobile (prepaid flow) | `/journey` | `/journey/prepaid/welcome` |
| Auth A1 Mobile (b2b2c flow) | `/journey` | `/journey/b2b2c/welcome` |
| Auth A1 Mobile (purchase / null) | `/journey` | `/journey` (unchanged) |

**Implementation:** `getAuthFlowBackPath(selectedFlow)` in `activation-routing.ts`, used by `MobileRoute` in `AuthRoutes.tsx`.

---

## Flow Entry + Hub

| Screen | Back shown | Target | Browser back |
|--------|:----------:|--------|--------------|
| Flow Entry | No | — | Exit / prior history |
| Flow Hub | No | — | Flow entry |

---

## Shared Auth

| Screen | Back target | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| A1 Mobile | `getAuthFlowBackPath(flow)` | **Fixed** prepaid/B2B2C |
| A2 OTP | A1 mobile | |
| A3 Vehicle owner | A2 OTP | |
| L1 Privacy | Prior auth screen | Via legal reader header |
| L2 Terms | Prior auth screen | Via legal reader header |

---

## Purchase (`/journey/purchase/*`)

| Screen | Back target |
|--------|-------------|
| R03 Vehicle | Flow entry / prior |
| R04 Fetching | R03 |
| R04b Fetch failed | R04 context |
| R05 Confirm | R03 |
| R06 Choose plan | R05 |
| R07 Rider cover | R06 |
| R08 Order summary | R07 |
| R08b Promo applied | R08 |
| R08c Invalid promo | R08 |
| R09 Processing | R08 (guarded if payment started) |
| R09b Still confirming | R09 |
| R10 Success | R09 (guarded — no re-checkout) |
| R10b Failed | R08 / retry path |
| R10c Unconfirmed | R09 |

Payment success guards (`redirectIfPaymentSucceeded`) prevent back into checkout — **by design, not a loop bug**.

---

## Prepaid / B2B2C

| Screen | Back target |
|--------|-------------|
| Prepaid welcome | Flow entry |
| B2B2C welcome (both variants) | Flow entry |

---

## Emergency (`/journey/emergency/*`)

| Screen | Back target |
|--------|-------------|
| R0 Rider prompt | `getEmergencyFlowBackPath(flow)` |
| R1–R4 Rider chain | Previous rider step |
| E0 Contacts empty | `getEmergencyFlowBackPath(flow)` |
| E1–E3 Contact chain | Previous contact step |
| E5 Contacts summary | E0 or prior |

Prepaid/B2B2C emergency entry backs to welcome — not purchase R10.

---

## Completed

| Screen | Back |
|--------|------|
| Journey completed | No back (terminal) |

---

## Post-Activation PWA (`/pwa/scan/*`)

| Area | Back behavior |
|------|---------------|
| Verify mobile → | Vehicle found |
| Verify OTP → | Verify mobile |
| Verify name → | Verify OTP |
| Park Me chain | Explicit previous park-me route |
| SOS entry | Vehicle / prior context |
| SOS holding | SOS entry |
| SOS leave confirm ↔ SOS | **Intentional loop** until user confirms leave |
| SOS terminal (resolved, cancelled) | No back or vehicle reset |

PWA uses explicit `navigate(path)` — no history stack dependency.

---

## Refresh + Resume

| Context | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Journey session | `localStorage` persistence restores flow + auth |
| PWA session | `PwaScanContext` session restore |
| Payment processing | Guards redirect forward on success |
| Deep link invalid | Wildcard → safe entry (flow root / PWA loading) |

---

## Hardware / Browser Back

React Router history stack mirrors explicit navigations. No custom `popstate` interceptors. Browser back follows stack — consistent with in-app back when user arrived via forward navigation.

---

## Verdict

**PASS** — One incorrect auth entry back target fixed globally via routing helper. No dead-end backs on interactive steps; terminal screens correctly omit back.
