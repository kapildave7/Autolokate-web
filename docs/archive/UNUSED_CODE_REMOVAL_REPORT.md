| `components/compositions/permission-row/` | Only used by archived R14 | N/A (R14 archived) | No |

### Dead feature folder

| Path | Why safe | Replaced by | Route dependency |
|------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| `features/qr-activation/` (QrScanScreen) | Routes redirect; screen never mounted | FlowEntryScreen + R03 redirect | No — `/journey/qr-scan` still redirects |

### Dead data modules

| Path | Why safe | Replaced by | Route dependency |
|------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| `features/qr-purchase/data/plan-data.ts` | P01–P05 only | purchase-plans.ts + purchase-pricing.ts | No |
| `features/qr-purchase/data/purchase-permissions.ts` | R14 only | N/A (archived) | No |
| `features/qr-purchase/screens/inventory.ts` | Dev catalog metadata | N/A | No |

## Cascade Cleanups (not file deletions)

| Item | Action |
|------|--------|
| `screens/index.ts` | Removed R14/R15/inventory exports |
| `types-checkout.ts` | Removed permission types (R14-only) |
| `purchase-pricing.ts` | Removed R15-only helpers; kept `getActivationCompleteTitle` for JourneyCompletedScreen |

## Intentionally Retained

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `purchase-activation/` screens + demo-data | demo-data used by vahan-demo, R05, PWA |
| `qr-prepaid/screens/pr01–pr03` | Dev preview catalog only; production uses PrepaidWelcomeScreen |
| `@autolokate/ui` unused exports | Consumed by ui-preview design system app |
| `docs/archive/` | Historical audit trail — not runtime code |
