# SOS Interaction Report

**Date:** 2026-06-17  
**Scope:** Hold-to-send correctness — frames 14, 14b

---

## Problem

Users could enter the SOS holding flow with a simple tap. Navigation to `/sos/holding` fired on `pointerdown`, and progress reset on route change caused inconsistent ring fill.

---

## Required behavior (Figma intent)

1. User **must hold** — tap alone does nothing
2. Progress ring fills over **2200ms** (`PWA_SOS_HOLD_MS`)
3. Release before complete → **cancel** (return to idle)
4. Complete hold → scene photos (route 15)

Route graph unchanged: **14 → 14b → 15**

---

## Implementation

### Engage gate (`PWA_SOS_HOLD_ENGAGE_MS = 200`)

| Phase | Route | Behavior |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Press | 14 | Record `holdStartAt`, start progress locally |
| < 200ms release | 14 | Reset — **no navigation** |
| ≥ 200ms still holding | 14 → 14b | Navigate with `{ holdStartAt }` in location state |
| Release before 100% | 14b → 14 | Cancel |
| Progress ≥ 100% | 14b → 15 | Complete |

### Progress continuity

`useHoldProgressFrom(holdStartAt, active, durationMs)` computes progress from absolute timestamp — no reset on 14→14b handoff.

### Button hardening (`AlSosHoldButton`)

- `setPointerCapture` on pointer down
- `onClick` → `preventDefault()` (blocks synthetic click)
- Haptic on start + completion (where supported)
- Visual: ring brightens, disc scales 0.98 while holding, completion glow at 100%

## Verification

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Quick tap on 14 | No route change ✅ |
| Hold < 200ms | No route change ✅ |
| Hold ≥ 200ms, release early on 14b | Returns to 14 ✅ |
| Full 2200ms hold | Advances to scene photos ✅ |
| Progress arc visible during hold | ✅ |
