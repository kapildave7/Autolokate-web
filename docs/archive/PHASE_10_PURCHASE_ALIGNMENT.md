# Phase 10 — Purchase Flow Alignment

**App:** `@autolokate/onboarding`  
**Date:** 2026-06-17  
**Scope:** Orchestration integration only — reuse existing P01–P06 screens, no redesign, no new UI components, no design-system changes  
**Baseline:** [PHASE_9_JOURNEY_ORCHESTRATOR.md](./PHASE_9_JOURNEY_ORCHESTRATOR.md)

---

## Executive summary

The **Purchase flow is connected to the Journey Orchestrator**. The Phase 9 placeholder at `/journey/purchase/*` is replaced with route-driven navigation through existing P01–P06 screens. After P06, the journey continues to the **Emergency segment entry** (placeholder acceptable).

**Flow:**

```
purchase.qr-scan (bootstrap redirect)
  → P01 Plan Selection
  → P02 Plan Details
  → P03 Rider Selection
  → P04 Checkout Summary
  → P05 Payment Processing (auto-advance)
  → P06 Payment Success
  → Emergency (/journey/emergency/rider-setup)
```

## 1. Route map

| Path | Step ID | Screen | Guard chain |
|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `/journey/purchase` | — | Redirect | → `/journey/purchase/qr-scan` |
| `/journey/purchase/qr-scan` | `purchase.qr-scan` | Redirect | `RequireAuthCompleted` + `RequireSelectedFlowMatch('purchase')` → P01 |
| `/journey/purchase/p01-plan-selection` | `purchase.plan-select` | P01 | same |
| `/journey/purchase/p02-plan-details` | `purchase.plan-details` | P02 | same |
| `/journey/purchase/p03-rider-selection` | `purchase.rider-select` | P03 | same |
| `/journey/purchase/p04-checkout-summary` | `purchase.checkout-summary` | P04 | same |
| `/journey/purchase/p05-payment-processing` | `purchase.payment-processing` | P05 | same |
| `/journey/purchase/p06-payment-success` | `purchase.payment-success` | P06 | same |
| `/journey/purchase/*` (unknown) | — | Redirect | → `/journey/purchase/qr-scan` |

### Auth handoff (unchanged entry)

After R06, `JourneySharedAuthRoute` navigates to `/journey/purchase/qr-scan`, which immediately redirects to P01.

### Post-purchase handoff (new)

P06 **Continue** → `setPhase('emergency')` → `/journey/emergency/rider-setup`

  P03 -->|Back| P02
  P04 -->|Back| P03
  P05 -->|Back| P04
  P06 -->|Back| P05
```

### Back navigation rules

| Step | Back target | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| P01 | `/journey/auth/r06-legal-consent` | Re-enters auth segment at last step |
| P02–P06 | Previous purchase step | Deterministic path map — no `navigate(-1)` |
| P05 | P04 | Timer cancelled on unmount if user backs out during processing |

### P05 auto-advance

Payment processing auto-navigates to P06 after **1.8s** (orchestration-only simulation; screen UI unchanged). Footer remains in processing state per existing P05 design.

---

## 3. Refresh recovery

| Scenario | URL after refresh | Recovery behavior |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Mid-purchase (e.g. P03) | `/journey/purchase/p03-rider-selection` | **Stays on P03** if `selectedFlow=purchase` + `authStatus=AUTH_COMPLETED` |
| Purchase URL, auth incomplete | Any `/journey/purchase/*` | Redirect → `/journey/auth/r01-vehicle-number` |
| Purchase URL, no flow selected | Any `/journey/purchase/*` | Redirect → `/journey` |
| Purchase URL, wrong flow (e.g. prepaid) | Any `/journey/purchase/*` | Redirect → `/journey/prepaid/entry` |
| Home refresh | `/journey` | Home; `selectedFlow` restored from `localStorage` if present |
| P05 refresh during timer | `/journey/purchase/p05-payment-processing` | Timer restarts → auto-advances to P06 again |

**Source of truth:** URL path for step position; `sessionStorage` (`al-journey-v1`) for auth + flow; `localStorage` (`al-selected-flow`) for flow persistence across sessions.

**Not persisted in Phase 10:** Plan/rider/checkout selections (screens remain presentational). Form/session field persistence is deferred.

---

## 4. Persistence audit

| Key | Storage | Field | Purchase impact |
|-----|---------|-------|-----------------|
| `al-selected-flow` | `localStorage` | `purchase` | Survives browser close; required for purchase route access |
| `al-journey-v1` | `sessionStorage` | `authStatus: AUTH_COMPLETED` | Required for activation segment; cleared on tab close |
| `al-journey-v1` | `sessionStorage` | `selectedFlow` | Mirrors localStorage on save |
| `al-onboarding-theme` | `localStorage` | `light` \| `dark` | Applies to purchase screens via DS tokens |

### Write points

| Event | Persistence action |
|-------|-------------------|
| Home flow select | `setSelectedFlow('purchase')` → both storages |
| R06 complete | `completeAuth()` → `authStatus = AUTH_COMPLETED` |
| P06 → Emergency | `setPhase('emergency')` — in-memory only |
| Start over (completed) | `clearJourney()` — clears both storages |

---

## 5. Route protection audit

| Guard | Applies to | Condition | Redirect |
|-------|------------|-----------|----------|
| `RequireAuthCompleted` | All `/journey/purchase/*` | `authStatus !== AUTH_COMPLETED` | `/journey/auth/r01-vehicle-number` |
| `RequireAuthCompleted` | All `/journey/purchase/*` | `selectedFlow == null` | `/journey` |
| `RequireSelectedFlowMatch('purchase')` | All `/journey/purchase/*` | `selectedFlow !== 'purchase'` | `getActivationEntryPath(selectedFlow)` or `/journey` |
| `RequireSelectedFlow` | Auth segment | No flow | `/journey` |

### Direct route access matrix

| Direct URL | `selectedFlow` | `authStatus` | Result |
|------------|----------------|--------------|--------|
| `/journey/purchase/p04-checkout-summary` | `purchase` | completed | **P04 renders** |
| `/journey/purchase/p04-checkout-summary` | `purchase` | pending | Auth R01 |
| `/journey/purchase/p04-checkout-summary` | `prepaid` | completed | `/journey/prepaid/entry` |
| `/journey/purchase/p04-checkout-summary` | null | any | `/journey` |
| `/journey/purchase/unknown-step` | `purchase` | completed | `/journey/purchase/qr-scan` |

---

## 6. Implementation summary

### New orchestration files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `journey/purchase/purchase-routing.ts` | Path constants + step sequence helpers |
| `journey/routes/PurchaseRoutes.tsx` | Route table + per-step navigation handlers |
| `journey/guards/JourneyRouteGuards.tsx` | Added `RequireSelectedFlowMatch` |

### Modified files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `journey/routes/JourneyRoutes.tsx` | Purchase segment → `PurchaseRoutes` (not placeholder) |
| `features/qr-purchase/screens/p01–p06` | Optional `onContinue` / `onBack` / `showBack` → `FlowStepShell` |
| `features/qr-purchase/types.ts` | `PurchaseScreenNavigationProps` |
| `flow/registry/config/flows.config.ts` | Insert `purchase.qr-scan` before P01 steps |
| `router/routes.schema.ts` | Journey purchase P01–P06 paths |

### Screen changes (orchestration-only)

Each P01–P06 screen accepts optional navigation props and passes them to `FlowStepShell`. **No layout, copy, or visual changes.**

---

## 7. Responsive QA

Purchase screens render inside `.journey-frame` (`min(100%, 24.5625rem)`) with existing `FlowStepShell` + `AlScreenBg` layout. No responsive changes were made in Phase 10.

| Viewport | Expected behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| **320px** | Single-column shell; plan carousel scrolls horizontally; footer pinned |
| **360px** | Same; step progress readable |
| **375px** | Same; primary reference width |
| **390px** | Same |
| **414px** | Same; max-width cap at 393px logical frame |

**Verify manually:** Run `pnpm --filter @autolokate/onboarding dev`, complete auth → purchase path, resize devtools at each width.

---

## 8. Theme QA

| Theme | Mechanism | Purchase impact |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Light** | `data-theme="light"` + `setThemeMode('light')` | DS surface/on-surface tokens on all P01–P06 |
| **Dark** | `data-theme="dark"` + `setThemeMode('dark')` | Same components, dark token set |

Theme is set on Home before purchase entry and persists via `al-onboarding-theme`. Purchase segment inherits without additional wiring.

---

## 9. Remaining placeholders

| Segment | Status | Route |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **purchase.qr-scan** | Redirect bootstrap only — no QrScan screen | `/journey/purchase/qr-scan` → P01 |
| **prepaid activation** | Placeholder | `/journey/prepaid/entry` |
| **b2b2c activation** | Placeholder | `/journey/b2b2c/partner-bridge` |
| **emergency suffix** | Placeholder | `/journey/emergency/rider-setup` |
| **completed** | Implemented | `/journey/completed` |

---

## 10. Verification

```bash
pnpm --filter @autolokate/onboarding lint
pnpm --filter @autolokate/onboarding build
pnpm --filter @autolokate/onboarding dev
```

### Smoke path

1. `/journey` → select **Consumer QR Activation + Purchase**
2. Complete R01–R06 → lands on P01 (via qr-scan redirect)
3. Continue P01 → P02 → P03 → P04 → P05 (auto) → P06
4. P06 Continue → `/journey/emergency/rider-setup`
5. Refresh on P03 → stays on P03
6. Open `/journey/purchase/p04-checkout-summary` without auth → redirected to R01
7. Select prepaid, then manually open purchase URL → redirected to prepaid entry
8. Toggle light/dark on Home → purchase screens respect theme

---

## 11. Alignment impact

| Dimension | Phase 9 | Phase 10 |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Purchase journey wiring | Placeholder | **P01–P06 live** |
| Purchase order vs target | Config + placeholder | **Config + runtime aligned** |
| Post-activation handoff | Simulated from placeholder | **P06 → Emergency automatic** |
| `purchase.qr-scan` | Entry URL only | **Bootstrap redirect (screen deferred)** |

**Overall journey alignment (purchase dimension): 85 → 95 / 100**

## Verdict

Phase 10 connects the **existing Purchase screens** to the **Journey Orchestrator** with route-driven navigation, guards, refresh-safe URLs, and P06 → Emergency handoff — without rebuilding screens or modifying the design system.
