# CSS Consolidation Report

**Date:** 2026-06-20

## Dead CSS Removed (via file deletion)

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `language-picker-sheet.css` | Component deleted |
| `language-switcher.css` | Component deleted |
| `r14-permissions.css` | Screen deleted |
| `r15-activation-complete.css` | Screen deleted |
| `qr-scan-screen.css` | Feature deleted |
| P01–P06 screen CSS files | Screens deleted |

**Bundle impact:** CSS 162 KB → 158 KB (−3.3 KB gzip −0.5 KB)

---

## Live CSS — Verified Retained

| File | Consumers |
|------|-----------|
| `purchase-phase-b.css` | R06–R08c (active) |
| `purchase-vehicle.css` | R03, R05 |
| `payment-success-hero.css` | R10 |
| `pwa-scan.css` | PWA routes |
| `emergency.css` | Emergency screens |
| `step-shell-chrome.css` | Auth + flow shells |

No orphaned selectors found in active stylesheets.

---

## Token Compliance (prior passes)

Hardcoded hex values in PWA reduced to design tokens in pixel-perfect passes. Remaining P2 items:

| File | Issue |
|------|-------|
| `plan-carousel.css` | rgba in keyframes — use success token |
| `rider-cover-options.css` | rgba badge — use color-mix |

Not changed this pass — no visual regression risk accepted.

---

## Duplicate CSS Patterns (P2 — documented)

| Pattern | Locations | Recommendation |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Step shell chrome | `auth-step-shell.css`, `step-shell-chrome.css` | Already shared via step-shell-chrome |
| PWA status hero spacing | `pwa-scan.css`, `pwa-emergency-screen.css` | Intentional per-screen Figma bands |
| Loading breathe animation | `interaction-motion.css` | Shared utility — OK |

---

## Verdict

**PASS** — Dead CSS eliminated with orphan file removal. Active CSS tied to mounted routes only.
