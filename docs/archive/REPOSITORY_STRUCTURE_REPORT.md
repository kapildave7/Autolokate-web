## Feature Ownership ✅

Each feature owns:
- `screens/` — route-mounted components
- `data/` — demo data + domain helpers
- `types.ts` — feature types
- Route files live in `journey/routes/` or `features/*/routes/`

No mixed-responsibility dumping grounds after cleanup.

## Removed Structure

| Removed | Was |
|---------|-----|
| `features/qr-activation/` | Dead QR scan feature |
| `features/qr-purchase/screens/p01–p06/` | Legacy purchase phase |
| `features/qr-purchase/screens/r14–r15/` | Archived screens |
| `components/compositions/language-*` | Unwired experiments |
| `components/compositions/permission-row/` | R14-only |

---

## New Structure

| Added | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `src/shared/` | Cross-feature utilities (format-mobile) |
| `@/` path alias | Clean imports from src root |

---

## Cohesive Large Files (retained)

| File | Lines | Justification |
|------|------:|---------------|
| `PurchaseRoutes.tsx` | ~861 | Route orchestration + guards |
| `EmergencyRoutes.tsx` | ~861 | Multi-path emergency graph |
| `ScreenDevApp.tsx` | ~930 | Dev preview harness (reduced from ~1043) |

Not split — readable and maintainable per user guidance.

---

## Verdict

**PASS** — Predictable feature-owned structure. Dead folders removed. Shared utilities extracted to `src/shared/`.
