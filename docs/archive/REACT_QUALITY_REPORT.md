# React Quality Report

**Date:** 2026-06-20  
**Scope:** TypeScript errors, React warnings, console output, memory leaks, animation safety

---

## 1. TypeScript ✅ PASS

- `apps/onboarding/tsconfig.json` — **0 errors**
- `packages/ui/tsconfig.json` — **0 errors**

---

## 2. Console Output ✅ CLEAN

| Type | Count | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `console.log` | 0 | None in production source |
| `console.warn` | 0 | None in production source |
| `console.error` | 1 | `PwaScanErrorBoundary.componentDidCatch` — intentional error-boundary logging |

The single `console.error` in `PwaScanErrorBoundary.tsx:33` is the correct pattern for error boundaries. It should eventually be wired to an error reporting service (Sentry, etc.) before production deployment.

---

## 3. TODO / FIXME / HACK Comments ✅ CLEAN

Zero found in `apps/onboarding/src/` (TypeScript and CSS files combined).

---

## 4. Animation Safety — FIXED

Three spinner animations lacked `prefers-reduced-motion` overrides. Fixed this session:

| Component | Animation | Fix Applied |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `TextField.css` | `al-text-field-spin` (0.8s infinite) | ✅ Added `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` → `animation: none` |
| `Toggle.css` | `al-toggle-spin` (slow linear infinite) | ✅ Added `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` → `animation: none` |
| `QuickAction.css` | `al-quick-action-spin` (0.8s infinite) | ✅ Added `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` → `animation: none` |

All other animations (confetti, plan carousel, rider cover, SOS aura, completion hero, step frame enter, dispatch timeline, screen spinner, scene photo card, etc.) already have correct `prefers-reduced-motion` overrides. ✅

---

## 5. Memory Leaks + Stale Effects

### PWA hooks
- `use-camera-capture.ts` — uses `useEffect` cleanup to stop media streams ✅
- `use-geolocation.ts` — geolocation API is fire-once, no subscription leak ✅
- `use-hold-progress.ts` — uses `clearInterval`/`clearTimeout` in cleanup ✅
- `use-pwa-photo-capture.ts` — cleans up object URLs on unmount ✅

### Journey context
- `JourneyContext.tsx` — no side-effect subscriptions, pure state management ✅
- No `useEffect` without proper cleanup dependencies found

---

## 6. Stale Refs / Stale Closures

No obvious stale closure patterns identified in hooks. All callbacks that reference state use correct dependency arrays.

---

## 7. React Warnings

No React-specific anti-patterns identified:
- No `key` prop missing on list renders (all use stable IDs)
- No missing deps in `useEffect` that would cause stale closures
- Error boundaries present: `PwaScanErrorBoundary` wraps the entire PWA route tree ✅
- No `setState` in unmounted component patterns

---

## 8. Unnecessary Re-renders

No obvious re-render issues:
- `JourneyContext` uses a single state object — avoids multiple subscription granularity issues
- PWA context (`PwaScanContext`) same pattern
- No inline object/array literals in JSX props that bypass memo on hot paths

---

## 9. Oversized Components

No component exceeds reasonable size (200+ lines of JSX). Largest screens are around 80–120 lines. Route handlers are extracted from component logic. ✅

---

## 10. Summary

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| TypeScript | ✅ 0 errors |
| console.log/warn | ✅ 0 |
| console.error | ✅ 1 (intentional, error boundary) |
| TODO/FIXME | ✅ 0 |
| prefers-reduced-motion | ✅ Fixed (3 spinners) |
| Memory leaks | ✅ No leaks detected |
| Stale effects | ✅ No stale patterns |
| React key warnings | ✅ None detected |
| Error boundaries | ✅ PwaScanErrorBoundary present |
