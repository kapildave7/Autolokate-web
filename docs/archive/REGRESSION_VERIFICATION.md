# Regression Verification

**Date:** 2026-06-20  
**Pass:** Production Hardening — post-fix verification  
**Method:** Automated checks + code-path review (browser MCP unavailable)

---

## Automated Verification ✅

| Check | Command | Result |
|-------|---------|--------|
| TypeScript | `pnpm -r typecheck` | ✅ PASS |
| ESLint | `pnpm -r lint` | ✅ PASS |
| Production build | `pnpm -r build` | ✅ PASS |

---

## Flow Verification (Code Path Review)

| Flow | Entry | Guards | Terminal | Status |
|------|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Auth** | `/journey/auth/mobile` | OTP/owner prereqs | → flow handoff | ✅ Unchanged |
| **Purchase** | R03 after auth | Auth + flow match + payment guards | R10 → Emergency | ✅ Effect fix only |
| **Prepaid** | `/journey/prepaid/welcome` | None | Emergency → Completed | ✅ Unchanged |
| **B2B2C** | `/journey/b2b2c/welcome` | None | Emergency → Completed | ✅ Unchanged |
| **Emergency** | contacts-empty / rider-prompt | Auth + selected flow | Completed | ✅ Unchanged |
| **PWA** | `/pwa/scan/loading` | Isolated session | Vehicle hub loop | ✅ Icon/layout fixes retained |
| **Completed** | Emergency continue | None | Finish → `/journey` | ✅ Unchanged |

**No route order, guard logic, business rules, or session schema changes made.**

---

## Theme Verification

| Theme | Mechanism | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Dark | `al-onboarding-theme` + design tokens | ✅ Token-based |
| Light | Theme toggle in dev/shell | ✅ No hardening changes |

---

## Responsive Verification

Prior signoff passes verified at 320, 360, 375, 390, 393, 414px. This hardening pass made **no CSS layout changes** except:

- SOS location chip spacing (prior Figma pass — retained)
- Deprecated prop migrations (no visual change)

**Responsive regression risk: Low**

---

## PWA-Specific Checks

| Screen | Change in Hardening | Regression Risk |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| SOS idle (`/pwa/scan/sos`) | Effect/timer fixes only | Low |
| SOS timeline resolved | Car + circle-check icons (prior pass) | None this pass |
| Park Me photos | Auto-locate ref gate | Low — same UX |
| Vehicle hub | `footerLabel` prop rename | None — same copy |
| Verify OTP | Removed unused destructure | None |

---

## Areas Not Re-Visualized (Tooling Limitation)

Browser automation was unavailable. Visual spot-check recommended at:

- `/pwa/scan/sos`
- `/pwa/scan/park-me/confirm-protected`
- `/pwa/scan/vehicle`
- `/journey/purchase/r06-choose-plan`
- `/journey/emergency/contacts-empty`

---

## Fixes Verified Non-Regressive

1. **PurchaseRoutes memoization** — prevents effect loops; same navigation behavior
2. **Geolocation mount guard** — prevents console warnings; same location capture UX
3. **ESLint cleanups** — no UX impact
4. **Relationship selector** — `RELATIONSHIP_OPTIONS` was alias; identical options

---

## Verdict

**PASS — No flow, navigation, or business-rule regressions detected.** Automated gates green. Visual re-check recommended for PWA SOS spacing at 375px (prior Figma work, not modified this pass).
