# Full Repository Audit

**Date:** 2026-06-20  
**Scope:** Entire monorepo — `apps/onboarding`, `packages/*`, build output, routing, state, CSS, design system  
**Truth hierarchy:** Figma → Screenshots → Audit Reports → Implementation Reports  
**Constraints honored:** No journey architecture, business rules, plan limits, payment logic, session schema, route order, flow order, guard logic, or Figma UX changes

## Executive Summary

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| TypeScript | ✅ PASS | 0 errors across workspace |
| ESLint | ✅ PASS | 0 errors after hardening pass |
| Build | ✅ PASS | Vite production build succeeds |
| React quality | ✅ PASS | No setState-in-render, cleanup patterns verified |
| Routing | ⚠️ GAPS | Documented guard/schema gaps — intentionally not changed |
| Bundle | ⚠️ WARN | 1.1 MB JS + 3.5 MB SOS wav asset |
| Dead code | ⚠️ P2 | Dev-only orphan screens (P01–P06, R14/R15) |

**Verdict:** **READY WITH KNOWN GAPS** — production-safe for demo mode; catalog/guard/deep-link gaps documented, not fixed per constraints.

## Phase 1 — Repository Health

### TypeScript / React / Build

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `pnpm -r typecheck` | ✅ 0 errors |
| `pnpm -r lint` | ✅ 0 errors |
| `pnpm -r build` | ✅ Success (~2.1s) |
| Explicit `any` | ✅ 0 occurrences |
| `@ts-ignore` / `@ts-expect-error` | ✅ 0 occurrences |
| `eslint-disable` | 3 intentional (deprecated API shims in auth screens + routes.schema) |

### Bundle Structure

| Asset | Size |
|-------|------|
| `index-*.js` | 1,098 KB (gzip 280 KB) |
| `index-*.css` | 162 KB (gzip 23 KB) |
| `sos-emergency-alarm-*.wav` | 3,528 KB |
| **Total dist** | ~4.6 MB |

Rollup warns on >500 KB chunk — expected given single-bundle onboarding app. SOS wav dominates total size.

### Large Files (>200 lines, justified)

| Lines | File | Justification |
|------:|------|---------------|
| 1043 | `dev/ScreenDevApp.tsx` | Dev-only preview harness |
| 861 | `journey/routes/PurchaseRoutes.tsx` | Route orchestration + session guards |
| 861 | `journey/routes/EmergencyRoutes.tsx` | Multi-path emergency graph |
| 689 | `features/post-activation-pwa/routes/pwa-sos-routes.tsx` | SOS timeline + hold state machine |
| 537 | `features/post-activation-pwa/routes/pwa-park-me-routes.tsx` | Park Me photo/location flow |
| 517 | `router/routes.schema.ts` | Catalog + legacy path registry |
| 422 | `features/post-activation-pwa/routes/pwa-shared-routes.tsx` | PWA verify + vehicle hub |
| 404 | `journey/routes/AuthRoutes.tsx` | Shared auth segment |
| 283 | `packages/ui/.../DispatchTimeline.tsx` | Figma timeline primitive |
| 263 | `packages/ui/utils/sos-alert-tone.ts` | Audio preload + tone logic |

All cohesive route files retained per maintainability-over-line-count rule.

### Dead / Duplicate Code

| Category | Finding | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Orphan purchase screens P01–P06 | Dev-only (`ScreenDevApp`) | Documented — not deleted (dev harness) |
| Archived R14/R15 | Not in route graph | Documented |
| `@autolokate/utils` | 0 runtime imports | Package reserved for future API layer |
| Mobile format helpers | 3 parallel implementations | Documented — low risk (demo mode) |
| UI exports unused in app | `AlBottomNav`, `AlContainer`, `AlGrid` | Shared library inventory — not dead |

### Circular Dependencies

Type-layer coupling: `journey/types.ts` ↔ `features/*/types`. Type-only at compile time; no runtime cycle detected.

## Issues Found vs Fixed (This Pass)

| Issue | Severity | Fixed | Files |
|-------|----------|-------|-------|
| ESLint deprecated prop usage (`PhotoGrid`, `ScannedVehicleCard`) | P1 | ✅ | `PhotoGrid.tsx`, `ScannedVehicleCard.tsx`, `pwa-shared-routes.tsx` |
| Purchase effect instability (`session.purchase ?? {}`) | P1 | ✅ | `PurchaseRoutes.tsx` |
| Geolocation unmount guard | P1 | ✅ | `use-geolocation.ts` |
| SOS hold timer stale closure | P2 | ✅ | `pwa-sos-routes.tsx` |
| Park Me auto-locate effect deps | P2 | ✅ | `pwa-park-me-routes.tsx` |
| Deprecated `RELATIONSHIP_OPTIONS` imports | P2 | ✅ | `EmergencyContactRow.tsx`, `RelationshipSelector.tsx` |
| Unused imports/vars lint failures | P2 | ✅ | Multiple PWA + auth files |
| Template literal ESLint (UI) | P2 | ✅ | `DispatchTimeline.tsx`, `ScreenSpinner.tsx` |
| `navigator.platform` deprecated | P2 | ✅ | `SosHoldButton.tsx` |

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Level | Regression Risk |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| ESLint/TS fixes | Low | Low — no flow changes |
| Purchase memoization | Low | Low — stabilizes effects only |
| Geolocation mount guard | Low | Low — prevents post-unmount setState |
| Deprecated prop removal | Low | Low — callers updated to `footerLabel` |
| Documented guard gaps | Medium | None — not modified |

---

## Remaining Gaps (Not Fixed — By Constraint)

1. Declarative guard catalog in `routes.schema.ts` not wired at runtime
2. Prepaid/B2B2C/completed routes lack auth guards
3. PWA verify deep links lack prerequisite redirects
4. `/activate/:token` in schema but not mounted
5. `phase` not persisted on refresh (self-heals via segment effects)
6. Bundle not code-split (P2 optimization)
7. Dev orphan screens remain in repo

---

## Final Repository Health Verdict

**READY WITH KNOWN GAPS** — codebase is lint-clean, type-safe, and builds successfully. Known gaps are architectural/documentation items explicitly excluded from this pass.
