# Performance Audit

**Date:** 2026-06-20  
**Scope:** Re-renders, bundles, animations, effects, CSS

---

## Build Output

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|------:|------------|
| JS bundle | 1,098 KB (gzip 280 KB) | ⚠️ Single chunk >500 KB |
| CSS bundle | 162 KB (gzip 23 KB) | ✅ Acceptable |
| SOS wav asset | 3,528 KB | ⚠️ Dominates dist size |
| Build time | ~2.1s | ✅ Fast |
| Modules transformed | 896 | — |

**Note:** Rollup chunk size warning is informational. Code-splitting would reduce initial load but was not applied — no route-order or lazy-load changes per constraints.

---

## Re-renders

| Area | Finding |
|------|---------|
| `JourneyContext` | Single state object — all consumers re-render on any session change. Acceptable for linear onboarding flow. |
| `PurchaseRoutes` | 18 effects — stabilized deps this pass to prevent loops |
| UI primitives | No excessive memo wrapping — appropriate |
| PWA routes | Local state for forms/OTP; session updates scoped to capture events |

**No unnecessary render hotspots identified requiring fix.**

---

## Animations

| Component | Reduced Motion | Status |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| SOS hold aura | Static 0.3 opacity (no idle pulse) | ✅ |
| Dispatch timeline | `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` | ✅ |
| Screen spinner | Reduced motion override | ✅ |
| Confetti (completed) | Respects reduced motion | ✅ |
| Plan carousel | Intentional scroll animation | ✅ |

**No layout thrashing or animation jank patterns in CSS review.**

---

## Heavy Effects

| Effect | Cost | Mitigation |
|--------|------|------------|
| Vahan demo fetch | Simulated async | Demo timer — acceptable |
| Payment processing timers | setTimeout chains | Cleaned up on unmount in PurchaseRoutes |
| SOS status advance | 10 effects in sos-routes | Timer cleanup on unmount ✅ |
| Reverse geocode | Async fetch per location | Fire-once on mount with ref gate |
| Photo compression | Canvas + JPEG encode | Runs on capture only |
| Lottie (plan carousel) | eval warning in build | Third-party — known |

---

## CSS Weight

- 162 KB total — includes all journey + PWA + emergency styles
- No duplicate `@keyframes` blocks requiring merge
- Token-based colors predominant post pixel-perfect passes

---

## Repeated Calculations

| Pattern | Location | Assessment |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Plan pricing | `purchase-pricing.ts` | Pure functions — no issue |
| Emergency limits | `emergency-limits.ts` | Single source of truth |
| Route progress | Per-flow progress maps | Computed on navigation — lightweight |

---

## Bundle Optimization Opportunities (P2 — Not Applied)

1. Dynamic import for PWA segment (separate entry from journey)
2. Lazy-load Lottie player
3. Compress or stream SOS wav (3.5 MB)
4. Manual chunks for `@autolokate/ui` vs app code

---

## Issues Fixed (Indirect Performance)

| Fix | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| Purchase effect stabilization | Eliminates effect re-run loops |
| Park Me auto-locate ref gate | Prevents duplicate geolocation requests |
| SOS hold ref guards | Prevents duplicate navigation timers |

---

## Verdict

**PASS for demo mode** — No blocking performance issues. Bundle size warning documented; SOS asset is primary optimization target for production CDN deployment.
