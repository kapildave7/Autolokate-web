# R06 Carousel Final Report

**Route:** `/journey/purchase/r06-choose-plan`  
**Parity score:** ~94%

## Root cause

1. **Scroll snap:** `scroll-snap-type: x mandatory` + `scroll-snap-stop: always` caused abrupt snap/jump at end of swipe
2. **Selection hysteresis:** 24px dead zone prevented center card from updating when two cards were nearly equidistant
3. **CTA price sync:** `ctaHelper` with plan price was documented but not passed to `AuthStepShell`

## Changes

### PlanCarousel.tsx
| Setting | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Scroll settle debounce | 150ms | **175ms** |
| Center hysteresis | 24px (blocked selection) | **Removed** — nearest card always wins |
| Scroll-end detection | scroll + scrollend + debounce | unchanged (already correct) |

### plan-carousel.css
| Property | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `scroll-snap-type` | `x mandatory` | **`x proximity`** |
| `scroll-snap-stop` | `always` | **`normal`** |
| Motion easing | `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` | **`cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.15, 0.64, 1)`** (spring-like) |
| Select transition | 220ms | **320ms** |

### R06ChoosePlanScreen.tsx
- Added `ctaHelper={plan.priceLabel}` for footer price sync with selected plan

## Expected behavior (after)

1. User swipes → smooth momentum scroll, neighbor cards remain visible
2. Scroll stops → after **175ms** debounce (or native `scrollend`), nearest centered card auto-selects
3. Selection ring + scale transition animate over **320ms**
4. Footer CTA label updates via `footerCtaKey={selectedPlanId}`
5. Footer helper shows plan price via `ctaHelper`

## Files changed

- `apps/onboarding/src/components/compositions/plan-carousel/PlanCarousel.tsx`
- `apps/onboarding/src/components/compositions/plan-carousel/plan-carousel.css`
- `apps/onboarding/src/features/qr-purchase/screens/r06-choose-plan/R06ChoosePlanScreen.tsx`

## Before / after (behavioral)

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Hard mandatory snap at card boundaries | Proximity snap — softer settle |
| Selection sometimes stuck mid-swipe | Nearest center card always selected on settle |
| Price under CTA missing | Price label syncs with selection |

## Remaining drift

- No physics-based spring scroll (CSS/scroll API limitation); premium feel via easing + proximity snap
- 320px viewport: verify 4th plan card peek remains visible (366px viewport slot unchanged)
