# Consumer App — Final Signoff (Sprint 4)

**Date:** 2026-06-17  
**Mode:** Audit only — no code changes  
**App:** `@autolokate/onboarding` · `apps/onboarding`  
**Figma:** [Autolokate · Consumer App](https://www.figma.com/design/FtHCUnE0HH586PtG5yJyG0/) · `FtHCUnE0HH586PtG5yJyG0`  
**Prior sprints:** Asset recovery (S1) · Pixel parity (S2) · Code hardening (S3)

---

## Verdict

# NOT READY

The consumer app is **not production-ready**. The primary **Purchase + Auth + Emergency** demo path is visually strong and largely wired, but **production build currently fails**, **prepaid/B2B2C flows are incomplete**, **emergency back-navigation breaks non-purchase flows**, and **all backends are demo/mock**.

**Demo / QA staging (purchase path only):** Acceptable for scripted walkthroughs with known credentials — not for production release.

## Overall score

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Overall consumer app** | **74 / 100** | Weighted across flows + cross-cutting concerns |
| Figma parity (implemented screens) | **98%** dark · **97%** light | Sprint 2 matrix — 32 journey screens |
| Functional completeness | **72 / 100** | Purchase strong; prepaid/B2B2C partial |
| Theme (dark + light) | **98 / 100** | `@autolokate/design-system` tokens; toggle in dev + system pref at boot |
| Responsive (320–414) | **98 / 100** | Shell max-width 393px; verified in parity matrix |
| Navigation & guards | **70 / 100** | P0 emergency back-nav; payment bypass on emergency |
| Session persistence | **68 / 100** | sessionStorage primary; tab-close data loss |
| Journey orchestration | **76 / 100** | Purchase end-to-end; prepaid/B2B2C registry ahead of router |
| Build / lint health | **50 / 100** | ESLint ✅ · **Vite production build ❌** |

### Scoring method

Per-flow score = **40% functional** + **40% Figma parity (implemented)** + **20% theme/responsive**.  
Overall = flow weights (Purchase 35%, Auth 20%, Emergency 25%, Prepaid 10%, B2B2C 10%) blended with cross-cutting build/navigation penalties.

## Per-flow scores

| Flow | Functional | Figma parity | Theme / responsive | **Flow score** | Signoff |
|------|------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|---------|
| **Auth** (A1–A3 + L1/L2) | 88 | 99% | 98 | **94** | Conditional demo |
| **Purchase** (R03–R10c) | 85 | 99% | 98 | **93** | Conditional demo |
| **Emergency** (R0–R4 + E0–E5) | 78 | 98% | 98 | **89** | Blocked (nav P0) |
| **Prepaid** | 40 | 96%† | 96 | **58** | No |
| **B2B2C** | 35 | 96%† | 96 | **54** | No |

†Parity scored on **implemented welcome screens only** (loading/error states included). Registry defines additional steps with **no mounted routes**.

### Build / lint (audit run 2026-06-17)

| Command | Result |
|---------|--------|
| `pnpm --filter @autolokate/onboarding lint` | ✅ Pass (0 errors) |
| `pnpm --filter @autolokate/onboarding build` | ❌ **Fail** |
| `tsc -p tsconfig.json` | ✅ Pass |

**Build failure (P0):** `FlowStepShell.tsx` imports deleted `../purchase-step-shell/purchase-step-shell.css` (removed in Sprint 3 hardening). Vite cannot resolve the asset.

---

## P0 blockers

Must fix before any production release or stakeholder “ready” signoff.

| # | Blocker | Impact | Evidence |
|---|---------|--------|----------|
| **P0-1** | **Production build broken** | Cannot ship artifact | `FlowStepShell.tsx` L17 → missing `purchase-step-shell.css` · Vite error on `pnpm build` |
| **P0-2** | **Emergency back-nav assumes purchase payment success** | Prepaid/B2B2C users hitting Back on R0 or E0 navigate to `/journey/purchase/r10-payment-success`, which requires `paymentStatus: 'success'` and `RequireSelectedFlowMatch flow="purchase"` — **navigation trap** | `EmergencyRoutes.tsx` L216–218, L482 |
| **P0-3** | **All auth/payment/Vahan/OTP/entitlement paths are demo/mock** | No real user validation or transactions | `auth-flow.validation.ts` · `vahan-demo.ts` · `purchase-payment-demo.ts` · `fetch-landing-entitlement.ts` |

---

## P1 improvements

High priority for production; acceptable for controlled demo with scripts if P0-1 and P0-2 are fixed.

| # | Item | Flow | Evidence |
|---|------|------|----------|
| P1-1 | Prepaid post-auth skips PR01–PR03 (activation code / validation) | Prepaid | `PrepaidRoutes.tsx` · `flows.config.ts` L50–52 |
| P1-2 | B2B2C missing offer-select + confirmation steps | B2B2C | `flows.config.ts` L60–62 · no screen files |
| P1-3 | Purchase users can deep-link to emergency without payment | Purchase + Emergency | `JourneyRoutes.tsx` L29–36 — no payment-success guard |
| P1-4 | R04b “Enter manually” is a dead end (Figma link present, no manual R05 path) | Purchase | `PurchaseRoutes.tsx` L333–340 vs L356–358 |
| P1-5 | Session progress lost on tab close (sessionStorage) | All | `persistence.ts` L12–35 |
| P1-6 | Journey completed screen is placeholder, not Figma terminal | All | `JourneyCompletedScreen.tsx` |
| P1-7 | Route catalog drift (`/entry`, `/partner-bridge` vs `/welcome`) | QA / tooling | `routes.schema.ts` vs `prepaid-routing.ts` · `b2b2c-routing.ts` |
| P1-8 | No automated tests for guards, persistence, or handoffs | All | Zero `*.test.*` in onboarding app |

---

## P2 polish

| # | Item | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| P2-1 | Auth re-entry allowed when `AUTH_COMPLETED` | `/journey/auth/*` unguarded |
| P2-2 | `phase` not persisted across refresh | `JourneyContext.tsx` |
| P2-3 | `/journey/completed` reachable without finishing journey | No guards |
| P2-4 | `/journey/flow-hub` exposed in production router | QA-only surface |
| P2-5 | S0 Splash not implemented | Figma `27:98` |
| P2-6 | R14 Permissions / R15 Activation complete — components only, no journey route | Dev catalog |
| P2-7 | Light theme A1 field border token vs Figma white stroke | Matrix P2 |
| P2-8 | `PromoCodeField` uses styled native inputs | Deferred in S3 hardening |
| P2-9 | Emergency index `/journey/emergency` always → rider-prompt (extra hop for Safe plans) | `JourneyRoutes.tsx` L59–61 |
| P2-10 | Dev catalog missing R08c, R09b, R10c previews | `ScreenDevApp.tsx` |

## Flow-by-flow signoff detail

### Auth — **94 / 100** · Conditional demo ✅

**Strengths:** A1→A2→A3 sequence with step guards; inline consent on A1; L1/L2 legal readers; offline handling; Figma parity **99%** dark on implemented frames; Sprint 3 `AlTextField` / `AlCheckbox` promotion.

**Gaps:** Demo mobile/OTP only; auth routes reachable after completion; no production identity provider.

### Purchase — **93 / 100** · Conditional demo ✅

**Strengths:** Full R03–R10c router; payment-state resume; promo branches; guarded prerequisites; **99%** dark parity; Sprint 2 footer/copy fixes (R09b, R04b link).

**Gaps:** Demo Vahan + payment; R04b manual entry dead end; R10c retry UX limited; real APIs required for prod.

### Emergency — **89 / 100** · Blocked ❌

**Strengths:** R0–R4 + E0–E5 wired; rider entitlement logic; 8-tile relation grid; **98%** dark parity; offline/error on R0.

**Gaps:** **P0 back-nav to purchase R10**; no payment guard for purchase flow; demo OTP/contacts; completed placeholder.

### Prepaid — **58 / 100** · Not signed off ❌

**Strengths:** Welcome screen with loading/error states; entitlement seeding via `applyLandingEntitlementToSession`; **96–97%** parity on welcome frames.

**Gaps:** PR01–PR03 unmounted; post-auth jumps to emergency; demo voucher API; registry/QA path drift.

### B2B2C — **54 / 100** · Not signed off ❌

**Strengths:** Partner welcome (plan-only + plan-rider URL variant); loading/error states; **96%** parity on welcome.

**Gaps:** 2 of 3 registry steps missing; no offer-select UI; same emergency back-nav P0 as prepaid.

---

## Recommended next steps (post-audit)

1. **Fix P0-1** — restore or relocate `purchase-step-shell.css` import in `FlowStepShell.tsx` (Sprint 3 regression).
2. **Fix P0-2** — flow-aware emergency back target (welcome or flow-specific activation, not purchase R10).
3. **Integrate real APIs** (P0-3) — auth OTP, Vahan, payment gateway, prepaid voucher, partner entitlement.
4. **Mount prepaid PR01–PR03** and **implement B2B2C offer-select + confirmation** per `flows.config.ts`.
5. **Add payment-success guard** on emergency segment for purchase flow (or document intentional bypass).
6. **Implement R04b manual vehicle entry** path to R05.
7. **Replace journey completed placeholder** with Figma terminal frame.
8. **Add guard/persistence integration tests** before re-signoff.
