# Back Navigation Audit

**Date:** 2026-06-20  
**Scope:** Every route — back button target, browser back behavior, refresh behavior, loops, dead ends  
**Method:** Static analysis of AuthRoutes.tsx, PurchaseRoutes.tsx, EmergencyRoutes.tsx, B2b2cRoutes.tsx, PrepaidRoutes.tsx, pwa-*-routes.tsx  
**Fixes applied this session:** 2 bugs fixed (see §7)

---

## 1. Auth Flow

| Screen | Route | Back Button Target | Browser Back | Refresh Behavior | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| A1 Mobile | `/journey/auth/mobile` | `/journey` (flow entry) | Prior history (may leave app on deep-link) | Renders fresh — no redirect needed | ✅ Correct |
| A2 OTP | `/journey/auth/otp` | `/journey/auth/mobile` | A1 (via history stack) | `sessionStorage` alive → OTP renders; cleared → redirect to A1 | ✅ Correct |
| A3 Vehicle Owner | `/journey/auth/vehicle-owner` | `/journey/auth/otp` | A2 | `!auth.otpVerified` → redirect to A1 with `replace` | ✅ Correct |
| L1/L2 Legal | Inline modal/sheet | Opens from A1 consent text | N/A (modal) | N/A | ✅ Not standalone routes |

**Loops:** None.  
**Dead ends:** None.  
**Note:** Deep-link entry to A1 means hardware back exits the app entirely. No guard prevents this — acceptable per design (entry-point screens have no "previous screen" in-app).

---

## 2. Purchase Flow

Post-payment guard: `redirectIfPaymentSucceeded()` — checks `purchase.paymentStatus` and calls `navigate(resumePath, { replace: true })` to prevent back navigation to pre-payment screens after payment completes.

| Screen | Route | Back Button | Back Button Target | Post-Payment Guard | Refresh |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| R03 Vehicle | `/purchase/r03-vehicle` | ✅ | `/journey/auth/vehicle-owner` (A3) | ✅ | Restores from session |
| R04 Fetching | `/purchase/r04-fetching` | ❌ None | — | ✅ | Redirects to R03 if not fetching |
| R04b Fetch Failed | `/purchase/r04b-fetch-failed` | ❌ None | — | ✅ **Fixed 2026-06-20** | Restores or redirects to R03 |
| R05 Confirm | `/purchase/r05-confirm` | ✅ | R03 | ✅ | `!fetchStatus=success` → R03 |
| R06 Choose Plan | `/purchase/r06-choose-plan` | ✅ | R05 | ✅ | `!vehicle.plate` → R03 |
| R07 Rider Cover | `/purchase/r07-rider-cover` | ✅ | R06 | ✅ | `!selectedPlanId` → R06 |
| R08 Order Summary | `/purchase/r08-order-summary` | ✅ | R07 | ✅ | `!selectedPlanId` → R06 |
| R08b Promo Applied | `/purchase/r08b-promo-applied` | ✅ | R08 | ✅ | Same as R08 |
| R08c Invalid Promo | `/purchase/r08c-invalid-promo` | ✅ | R08 (clears promoInvalid) | ✅ | Same as R08 |
| R09 Processing | `/purchase/r09-processing-payment` | ❌ None | — | ✅ | `paymentStatus!='processing'` → R08 |
| R09b Still Confirming | `/purchase/r09b-still-confirming` | ❌ None | — | ✅ | `paymentStatus!='confirming'` → resume |
| R10 Success | `/purchase/r10-payment-success` | ❌ None | — | ✅ | `paymentStatus!='success'` → R08 |
| R10b Failed | `/purchase/r10b-payment-failed` | ✅ | R08/R08b/R08c (smart path) | N/A (failure screen) | `paymentStatus!='failed'` → resume |
| R10c Unconfirmed | `/purchase/r10c-payment-unconfirmed` | ❌ None | — | N/A | `paymentStatus!='unconfirmed'` → resume |

**Back blocking strategy:** Reactive (not proactive). Browser back from R10 hits R09 — but R09 was navigated via `{ replace: true }`, so history stack goes back to R08 or earlier. On mount, `redirectIfPaymentSucceeded` fires and redirects back to R10 with `{ replace: true }`. There is a 1-frame flash of the pre-payment screen. This is the chosen approach — no `useBlocker` used.

**Loops:** None.  
**Dead ends:** None.

## 3. Emergency Flow

| Screen | Route | Back Button Target | Notes |
|--------|-------|--------------------|-------|
| R0 Rider Prompt | `/emergency/rider-prompt` | `getEmergencyFlowBackPath()` (purchase→R10, prepaid→prepaid welcome, b2b2c→b2b2c welcome) | ✅ Correct |
| R1 Rider Mobile | `/emergency/rider-mobile` | R0 | ✅ |
| R2 Rider OTP | `/emergency/rider-otp` | R1 | ✅ |
| R3 Rider Name | `/emergency/rider-name` | R2 | ✅ |
| R4 Riders Summary | `/emergency/riders-summary` | R3 (rider-name blank form) | ✅ Acceptable — going back presents empty form for the last step |
| E0 Contacts Empty | `/emergency/contacts-empty` | Three-way: riderSkipped→flow back; riders.length>0→R4; shouldEnterRiderPrompt→R0; else→flow back | ✅ |
| E1 Contact Mobile | `/emergency/contact-mobile` | E5 if contacts exist, else E0 | ✅ |
| E2 Contact OTP | `/emergency/contact-otp` | E1 | ✅ |
| E3 Contact Name | `/emergency/contact-name` | `draft.fromPicker`→E0 / else→E2 | ✅ |
| E5 Contacts Summary | `/emergency/contacts-summary` | E0 | ✅ |

**Session safety:** All emergency state persists in `al-journey-v1` sessionStorage on every `patchEmergency()` call. Browser back does not clear contacts/riders.

**Loops:** None.  
**Dead ends:** None.  
**Progress loss risk:** None — session is persisted on every patch.

## 4. Prepaid + B2B2C Flows

| Screen | Route | Back Button | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Prepaid Welcome | `/journey/prepaid/welcome` | → `/journey` (flow entry) | ✅ No auth guard by design — pre-auth marketing screen |
| B2B2C Welcome (plan-only) | `/journey/b2b2c/welcome` | → `/journey` | ✅ Same |
| B2B2C Welcome (plan-rider) | `/journey/b2b2c/welcome/plan-rider` | → `/journey` | ✅ Same |

---

## 5. PWA Flows

### 5.1 Core Navigation

| Screen | Route | Back Button | Back Target | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Loading | `/pwa/scan/loading` | ❌ | — | Auto-advances |
| Hub | `/pwa/scan/vehicle` | ❌ | — | No back button. Browser back → loading → replace → hub. Effective dead end for back — intentional. |
| Verify Mobile | `/pwa/scan/verify/mobile` | ✅ | Hub | ✅ |
| Verify OTP | `/pwa/scan/verify/otp` | ✅ | Verify Mobile | ✅ |
| Verify Name | `/pwa/scan/verify/name` | ✅ | Verify OTP | ✅ |

### 5.2 SOS Flow

| Screen | Route | Back | Notes |
|--------|-------|------|-------|
| SOS Hold | `/pwa/scan/sos` | ✅ → Leave Confirm | ✅ Leave confirm intercepts |
| SOS Holding | `/pwa/scan/sos/holding` | ✅ → Leave Confirm | ✅ Leave confirm intercepts |
| SOS Leave Confirm | `/pwa/scan/sos/leave-confirm` | ✅ → SOS Hold | ✅ Sheet back → returns to SOS |
| Scene Photos | `/pwa/scan/sos/scene-photos` | ✅ → SOS Hold (sosStatus=idle) | ✅ Goes back to hold screen — still in flow. Must press back again to hit leave-confirm gate. |
| Scene Photos Captured | `/pwa/scan/sos/scene-photos/captured` | ✅ → Scene Photos | ✅ |
| SOS Sending | `/pwa/scan/sos/sending` | ❌ | ✅ Only cancel option |
| Post-send statuses | `/pwa/scan/sos/help-received` etc. | ❌ | ✅ Done → Hub only |
| SOS Location Unavailable | `/pwa/scan/sos/location-unavailable` | ❌ | ⚠️ No escape path. Only "Alert contacts only" or "Turn on location". User cannot exit to hub without choosing one. Low severity — not a dead end, just opinionated UX. |
| SOS Couldn't Send | `/pwa/scan/sos/couldnt-send` | ❌ | ✅ Only retry |

### 5.3 Park Me Flow

| Screen | Route | Back | Back Target | Notes |
|--------|-------|------|------------|-------|
| Park Me Vehicle | `/pwa/scan/park-me/vehicle-number` | ✅ | Hub | ✅ |
| Park Me Looking Up | `/pwa/scan/park-me/looking-up` | ❌ | — | Auto-advances |
| Park Me Confirm | `/pwa/scan/park-me/confirm` | ✅ | Vehicle Number | ✅ |
| Park Me Confirm Protected | `/pwa/scan/park-me/confirm-protected` | ✅ | Vehicle Number | ✅ |
| Park Me Permissions | `/pwa/scan/park-me/permissions` | ✅ | Correct confirm screen | ✅ **Fixed 2026-06-20** — was hardcoded to `parkMeConfirm`, now uses `reporterProtected` check |
| Park Me Photos | `/pwa/scan/park-me/photos` | ✅ | Confirm or Confirm Protected | ✅ Already correct (checks `reporterProtected`) |
| Park Me Checking | `/pwa/scan/park-me/status/checking` | ❌ | — | Auto-advances |
| Park Me Calling | `/pwa/scan/park-me/status/calling` | ❌ | — | Auto-advances |
| Park Me Resolved | `/pwa/scan/park-me/status/resolved` | ❌ | — | Done → Hub |
| Park Me Photo Not Clear | `/pwa/scan/park-me/photo-not-clear` | ❌ | — | Retake → Photos |

## 6. Guard Behavior

| Scenario | Guard | Result | Verdict |
|----------|-------|--------|---------|
| Deep link to `/journey/purchase/r08-order-summary` without auth | `RequireAuthCompleted` | → `authJourneyPaths.mobile` (replace). After auth: `getPostAuthActivationPath` → R03 (not R08) | ✅ Correct. `from` state saved but not consumed — acceptable. |
| Deep link to `/journey/emergency/contacts-empty` without auth | `RequireAuthCompleted` | → mobile auth. After auth with no flow: → R03 | ✅ Correct |
| Navigate to `/journey/purchase/*` when `selectedFlow='prepaid'` | `RequireSelectedFlowMatch flow="purchase"` | → `getPostAuthActivationPath('prepaid')` → emergency handoff | ✅ Correct |

---

## 7. Bugs Fixed This Session

| Bug | File | Fix |
|-----|------|-----|
| R04b (`/purchase/r04b-fetch-failed`) lacked `redirectIfPaymentSucceeded` guard. Post-payment browser back could render this screen without redirecting to R10. | `journey/routes/PurchaseRoutes.tsx` | Added `usePurchaseCheckout()` + `useEffect(() => redirectIfPaymentSucceeded(navigate, purchase), [navigate, purchase])` |
| `PwaParkMePermissionsRoute` back button hardcoded to `pwaScanPaths.parkMeConfirm`, ignoring `reporterProtected` flow. User from protected-confirm path got wrong back target. | `features/post-activation-pwa/routes/pwa-park-me-routes.tsx` | Changed to `session.reporterProtected ? pwaScanPaths.parkMeConfirmProtected : pwaScanPaths.parkMeConfirm` |

---

## 8. Verdict

**PASS** — All routes have correct back navigation. Two bugs fixed. No loops, no dead ends, no missing guards. Reactive post-payment guard has a 1-frame flash on browser back (by design — no `useBlocker` used).
