# Icon Alignment Report

**Date:** 2026-06-17  
**Scope:** Post-Activation PWA — icon parity audit (size, stroke, container, optical centering)

---

## Method

Visual comparison of icon wells, glyphs, and timeline markers against Figma CC tracker + scanner confirmation nodes. No route or logic changes.

---

## Changes applied

| Location | Issue | Fix |
|----------|-------|-----|
| **`AlVehicleConfirmationCard`** (new) | Purchase RC card used 44px wells — wrong hierarchy for scanner confirm | 40×40 well, 10px radius, 18px car stroke 1.75; 16px shield badge |
| **`AlStatusTracker` vehicle chip** | 44×12px well drifted from scanner card + timeline density | **40×10px** well to match confirmation card |
| **`AlDispatchTimeline` SOS** | Active/completed glyph sat high vs label baseline; step too tall @320 | `padding-top: 0` on copy; SOS steps `align-items: center`; `stepMinHeight` 36→34 |
| **`AlPhotoGrid` review-quad retake** | Missing retake affordance on 15b | 32px circular retake well, 24px refresh glyph, top-right 12px inset |
| **`PwaStatusHeroScreen`** | Hero visual oversized vs Figma status frames | Visual container 188px (was 200px); tighter title/description gap |

---

## Verified unchanged (already aligned)

| Component | Screen(s) | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| `AlSosHoldButton` | 14, 14b | Ring/disc alignment fixed in rebuild sprint |
| `AlScannerHubCard` icons | 02 | 24px `square-parking` / `bell` in hub rows |
| `AlScenePhotoCard` | 09, 15 | Stacked label-above-icon layout |
| `AlScreenSpinner` emergency tone | 17 | Red spinner in SOS sending aura |
| Timeline complete glyph | 10–12, 19–21 | 24px park-me / 18px SOS concentric check |

---

## Auth reuse screens (03–05)

Icons inherit **`A1` / `A2` / `A3`** onboarding screens (`ob-step-chrome`). No PWA-specific icon overrides applied — shell chrome differs from `PwaScanShell` wordmark header. **Residual drift:** header/back treatment, not glyph metrics.

**Grade impact:** B (acceptable reuse constraint; no navigation change)

## Icon inventory by screen

| Screen | Primary icons | Size | Status |
|--------|---------------|------|--------|
| 01, 07, 17 | Spinner | lg | ✅ |
| 02 | Parking, bell, chevron | 24 / 22 | ✅ |
| 08, 08b | Car, shield (inline SVG) | 18 / 16 | ✅ new card |
| 09, 15 | Camera | 24 | ✅ |
| 09b, 15b | Retake refresh | 24 in 32px well | ✅ |
| 10–13, 19–21, 23 | Timeline glyphs | 18–24 | ✅ polished |
| 14–14d | SOS hold, location | 72dp / 24 | ✅ |
| 16, 18, 22 | Incident hero Lottie/SVG | 188px frame | ✅ |

## Remaining icon drift

| Screen | Gap | Severity |
|--------|-----|----------|
| 03–05 | Onboarding chrome vs PWA wordmark shell | Low — out of sprint scope |
| 02 hub | `AlScannedVehicleCard` 44px well (hub variant, intentional) | Low — different component role |
